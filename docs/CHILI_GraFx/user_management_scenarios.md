# User management

## Scenarios

The description above explains the theory. Below are some examples how to organize your users, based on your profile.

### Brand Owner

As the owner of the access to CHILI platform, you will have the Subscription Admin access.

How you organize the other levels will depend on your organization.

The main thought process is: who needs access to one or more resources, and how do I combine or separate these resources?

**Example 1**: Brand-owner with 1 brand.

All resources for your brand can be stored into 1 Environment.

Environment Admin is the Brand Manager, or whoever is responsible for managing the brand assets and smart templates.

End-users are the consumers of the templates, able to make publications. These end-users could be local marketing responsibles.

**Example 2**: Brand-owner with multiple brands, available worldwide

Each brand has its own Environment.

Subscription Admin: IT responsible, Global Brand manager, CMO

Environment Admin is the brand manager, responsible for the group of smart templates, related to his/her group of brands.

End-users are the consumers of the templates, able to make publications. They can be the local marketing users.

**Example 3**: Brand-owner with several brands, and regional management/ownership of these products.

Each brand has its own Environment. Organizations help to group brands, even if they are separated over multiple environments.

Subscription Admin: IT responsible, Global Brand manager, CMO

Organization Admin: The responsible for a a group of Brands. The subscription admin organizes these groups, and assigns a user, and a set of environments to the organization.

Environment Admin is the brand manager (for 1 brand, if necessary). this could also be the same user as the Organization Admin.

Environment Admin could also be the global marketing responsible for this brand.

The end-users are the local marketing people, able to make publications from the available templates.
