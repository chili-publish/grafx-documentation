# User management

## User creation and invitation

### First user

The first user will be the subscription Admin, and is created by CHILI GraFx, as a result of a signed contract.

The first user could also be created, by the migration from MyCP. If you had a user in MyCP, and you followed the migration process, this user is now a CHILI GraFx user. (Subscription Admin for now)

### Subsequent Users

You can add more users to the Subscription, by converting them from MyCP.

You can also add users by asking a Client Success colleague to create a new user.

!!! Alert
	In a later version, you will be able to invite users to you subscription
