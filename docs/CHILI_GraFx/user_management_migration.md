# User management

## Migration

If you had a CHILI publisher Online subscription before, a migration tool will convert the users into CHILI GraFx users.

Since the permission setup is different, there will be no 1/1 mapping.
During Phase 1 - Timeframe [UNCLEAR] - all users will be converted as Subscription Admin. This will enable the application to keep working.
It's up to the Subscription Admin (first user) to assign new CHILI GraFx roles to these converted users.

In a second phase - Timeframe [UNCLEAR] - a smart mapping of the permissions will take place.
