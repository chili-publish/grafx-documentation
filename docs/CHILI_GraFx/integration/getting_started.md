# Integrate CHILI GraFx

The **GraFx Platform API** allows you to connect server-side through the REST api.

Use cases are

- User management
- Designer seat management
- Environment creation
- Buy (Render pack) add-ons

# Authenticate

Before you can start, you'll need an API user | token.
With these credentials, you can initiate your Object.

# Make the call(s)

Once your object is instantiated, you use classes & functions, as listed in the [API reference](../api_reference/).
