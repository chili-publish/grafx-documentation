# User management

## Scope of permissions

The scope of the permissions is the concept that not all permissions have the same impact. Some permissions have impact on a different level.

The schema below shows the relation between the levels in a CHILI GraFx Subscription, to then explain the impact of permissions (roles) on these levels

### A GraFx Subscription

Roles defined on the Subscription level have permission with impact for all environments.
These contain operations like managing the lifecycle of identities and environments.

### Organization

An organizaion is an optional grouping you can define. An organization groups 1 or more environments.

Roles at the organization level have impact on all environments in this organization.

### Environment

An environment is the smallest level, where documents are grouped to serve an application. The minimum restriction you can apply to a set of resources, is the environment level.

Roles (and permissions) on the environment level affect only the specific environment.
