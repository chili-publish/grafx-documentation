# GraFx Media vs DAM

GraFx Media could be seen as a DAM (Digital Asset Management) system. But there are some key differences.

## DAM System (Digital Asset Management)

- Think of a DAM system like a library for your digital stuff. It's a place where you can store not only your digital assets (like images, videos, documents) but also a bunch of information about them.
- In addition to the actual files, a DAM system keeps track of important details about those files, such as who created them, when they were created, what they're used for, and much more. This additional information is called metadata.
- It's like having a library where each book not only has the book itself but also a card with details about the author, publication date, genre, and so on. This makes it easier to find and manage your digital stuff.
- Moreover, DAM systems often allow you to create a system of organization through taxonomy and tagging. Taxonomy involves creating a structured hierarchy or categorization for your assets, like sorting books into genres in a library. Tagging, on the other hand, lets you add descriptive keywords to assets, making them even more searchable and discoverable. So, you can think of taxonomy and tagging as the equivalent of having a well-organized library catalog, helping you quickly locate and retrieve the specific digital assets you need.

## GraFx Media

GraFx Media is not a DAM in the definition we have above.

GraFx Media is a repository to store the assets that are used in the Smart Templates.

GraFx Media stores this info as metadata:

- Name
- Asset size
- Asset ID
- Asset Type

## Connectors

GraFx Media uses the CHILI GraFx Connector Framework. This means that later, when more developers add connectors to DAM systems, you'll be able to link your existing DAM system and use the assets in the editors GraFx Publisher and GraFx Studio.
