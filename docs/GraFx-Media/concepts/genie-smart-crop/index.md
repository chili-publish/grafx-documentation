## Upload

![screenshot-full](step1-2.png)

After upload (step 1), GraFx Genie will find the subject in your image (step 2), and define 2 elements

- Subject Area
- Point of Interest

## Subject Area

The subject area is the frame around the subject recognized as the most important element in the image.

## Point of Interest

The Point of Interest, is the point in that subject area, where the focus should be.

This Point of Interest will assist the AI assistant (GraFx Genie) during output generation, to make dure the focus is always on this point.

## GraFx Studio

In GraFx Media, the AI assistent sets these elements. From now on, the meta data can be used during Template Creation with GraFx Studio.
