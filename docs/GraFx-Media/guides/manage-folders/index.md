# Manage Folders in GraFx Media

## Introduction

GraFx Media is used to store your assets you will use in [GraFx Studio](/GraFx-Studio/) and [GraFx Publisher](/GraFx-Publisher/).

Assets are arranged in folders and subfolders.

Assets can be uploaded in a folder, not on the root level of GraFx Media.
