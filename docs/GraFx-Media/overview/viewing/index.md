# Viewing assets in GraFx Media

When opening GraFx Media, you see the top level directory of your assets.

Just like with your "Finder" or "Explorer", your assets are organised in folders and subfolders.

These assets are the same as in your [GraFx Publisher backoffice](https://chilipublishdocs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPDOC/pages/1413932/Asset+Management){target="_blank"}.
