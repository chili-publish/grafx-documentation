# On-premise software

Since 2010, CHILI publisher was sold as the smart template solution for print and static digital output and variant production.

This product is installed on-premise at the customers (virtual) hardware.

CHILI publisher (legacy) is **end-of-life**.

To benefit continued support and maintenance, switch to GraFx Publisher.

[GraFx Publisher](/GraFx_publisher/intro/) is the application based on CHILI publisher, hosted in the [CHILI GraFx platform](/CHILI_GraFx/intro/).
