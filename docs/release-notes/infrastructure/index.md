# Infrastructure - Release notes

## Mar 31, 2023

Your [CHILI GraFx](/CHILI_GraFx/) infrastructure has been upgraded to have the latest update.

With this update, we’re implementing platform infrastructure changes that greatly enhance  performance.

The update does require planned downtime, and will be transparant for you.

The update will be implemented (starting April 5) gradually on all tenants, and will happen over the following days and weeks.
