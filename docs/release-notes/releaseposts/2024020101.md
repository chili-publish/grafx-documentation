??? note "Change in URLs"
	We've updated the way how our URLs in the platform are built.
    This means that if you have bookmarks (especially if they are linking to a certain environment) that the URLs will bring you to a 404.
    This change was necessary to have a more consistent way of navigating the platform.
    Please update your bookmarks to follow the new structure.

## Features

- A user can be added to a user group when they are invited to CHILI GraFx for the first time or from the User Management page on CHILI GraFx
- User Group membership, User Group details (name & description) and assignment of environment and roles are managed by the Subscription Admin
