??? note "Change in URLs"
	We've updated the way how our URLs in the platform are built.
    This means that if you have bookmarks (especially if they are linking to a certain environment) that the URLs will bring you to a 404.
    This change was necessary to have a more consistent way of navigating the platform.
    Please update your bookmarks to follow the new structure.
