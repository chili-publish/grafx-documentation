# GraFx Studio

Version 0.114.1, using Studio SDK [0.114.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

## Features

- We added [15 blend modes](../../../../../GraFx_Studio/concept/blendmodes/) that can be applied to your image and text content to improve your template design

## Improvements

- Animation snaps to 0,1 seconds on the timeline, which makes it easier to align the animation of multiple frames

- Frames are only selectable and editable on the canvas while they are visible in the animation (this fixes some issues with entering text edit mode)
- While in text edit mode, you can now also edit the frame properties and change the copyfitting settings

## Fixes

- Fixed some issues with the color picker component to select a custom color or a swatch or to change the opacity
- Fixed issue where fonts were not loaded when the dialog to add fonts was opened too quickly
