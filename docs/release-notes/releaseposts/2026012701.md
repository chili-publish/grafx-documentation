# Environment API update

![CHILI GraFx Environment API icon](/assets/icon-CHILI-GraFx.svg){.rn_icon}

## ✨ New & Improved

- **Added optional PDF post-processing step**  
  Generated PDFs can now be automatically adjusted after rendering. This makes it possible to apply compliance rules, corrections, or standardization without changing templates or client-side integrations.

- **Improved reliability when updating templates concurrently**  
  When multiple updates to the same template happen at the same time, saves are now handled sequentially. This ensures that templates are stored consistently and prevents incomplete or conflicting updates.

- **Improved readability of error reports**  
  Error report records are now returned in a predictable, human-friendly order. This makes it easier to review results and match errors to input records, especially when processing many items in parallel.

- **Added optional descriptions to Subject Types**  
  Subject Types can now include an optional description field. This helps teams document intent and meaning, making configurations easier to understand and maintain across environments.

## 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed issues with overlapping template updates**  
  Simultaneous save operations no longer risk leaving templates in an inconsistent or partially updated state.
