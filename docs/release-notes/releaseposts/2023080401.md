## Fixes

- Fixed issue where ‘Rename’ option was available for several selected variables at once in the ‘Variable List’
- Fixed issue where the ‘Delete’ option only removed one variable when multiple were selected. Right now all selected variables will be removed from the ‘Variable List’
- Fixed issue where an executed action is added to undo stack when switching between text variable input fields
- Fixed issues where playing the animation, made the timeline player move in blocks instead of moving smoothly over the timeline.
- Fixed issue where the finished animation didn’t change the pause button back to play.
