![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.34</span>

## ✨ New & Improved

### GraFx Studio

- **Added bulleted lists in paragraph styles**  
  You can now [define and apply bulleted lists](/GraFx-Studio/guides/bulleted-lists/) through paragraph styles, including assigning a character style to control the visual styling of the bullet itself.

- **Improved frame selection**  
  Ctrl/Cmd-click now cycles through overlapping frames at the cursor and collapses multi-selection to the topmost hit for more precise control.

- **Extended HTML output (Experimental)**  
  The HTML renderer now supports **frame opacity**, aligning HTML output with standard visual behavior.
