# GraFx Studio adds number variables

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-10.svg)

Number variables enable easy numeric input within the limits set by the template designer. You can set minimum and maximum values and define the formatting on the page, by specifying decimal and thousands separators, determining the number of decimal places, and selecting a character style for the decimals.
