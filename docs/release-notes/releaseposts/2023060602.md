## Features

- You can change the [corner radius](/GraFx-Studio/guides/shape-frame/) of your rectangle and polygon shapes by dragging the round handles in the shape or by using the corner radius properties in the frame properties panel

## Improvements

- When a new frame is added it is only visible on the selected layout and its sub-layouts, on all other layouts the frame is hidden (if you want a frame to be visible on all layouts you should add it on the top-level layout)
