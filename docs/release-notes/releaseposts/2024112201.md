# GraFxÂ Studio - New milestone achieved!

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

With **anchoring**, **layout presets**, and **Design & Run mode**, GraFx Studio gets a milestone update that makes it easier and faster than ever to produce unlimited numbers of on-brand graphics at different output sizes, for print and digital channels.

## New features

- Get total control over how your design should automatically adapt when the page size changes with the new [anchoring](/GraFx-Studio/guides/anchoring/) feature. You can use the simple controls to set it up, while the frame's anchor lines help you to set the correct offsets.
- With the [layout presets](/GraFx-Studio/guides/layouts/) you can choose from a library of the most common print, social, display, and DOOH formats to quickly create multiple layouts at once.
- The new [Design & Run mode](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/design-run/) lets you easily test your template as an end-user, without leaving the workspace! And you can rest assured you're not messing up your original design while testing it.

## Improvements

- When a font in the template is not found it is automatically replaced by a font with the same name (if it exists)
- You can use `setNumberVariableDecimalPlaces()` in an action to change the number of decimal places of a number variable

## Fixes

- Fixed output generation sometimes using the Default layout instead of the selected layout
- Fixed styling not being applied to the second variable in a text frame
- Fixed issue with some special characters in text frames
- Fixed Esc key behavior while creating a frame
- Fixed image picker preview not showing for assets that are used for the first time
- Fixed the layout width and height properties in an action now returning the actual layout size
- Fixed use of `null` to remove a prefix or suffix via an action (f.i. `studio.variables.setPrefix("Price", null);`)
