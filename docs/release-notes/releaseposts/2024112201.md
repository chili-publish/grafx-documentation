# GraFx Studio - New milestone achieved!

![rn_icon](../../../../../assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

With **Anchoring**, **Layout Presets**, and **Design & Run mode**, GraFx Studio gets a milestone update that makes it easier and faster than ever to produce unlimited numbers of on-brand graphics at different output sizes, for print and digital channels.

## New features

- Take full control over how your design adapts to page size changes with the new [Anchoring](../../../../../GraFx-Studio/guides/anchoring/) feature. Simple controls make setup easy, while the frame’s anchor lines ensure accurate offsets.
- Create multiple layouts in seconds with [Layout Presets](../../../../../GraFx-Studio/guides/layouts/). Choose from a library of common formats for print, social, display, and DOOH to streamline your workflow.
- Easily test your templates as an end-user with the new [Design & Run mode](../../../../../GraFx-Studio/concepts/design-run/) – all without leaving your workspace. Plus, you can rest assured that your original design remains untouched while testing.

!!! note "Default anchoring behavior"

    With the introduction of anchoring, all frames are relatively anchored to the page by default, allowing them to automatically adapt to page size changes. Existing templates will retain frames anchored to the top-left corner of the page, preserving their original behavior.
    
## Improvements

- When a font in the template is not found it is automatically replaced by a font with the same name (if it exists)
- You can use `setNumberVariableDecimalPlaces()` in an action to change the number of decimal places of a number variable

## Fixes

- Fixed output generation sometimes using the Default layout instead of the selected layout
- Fixed styling not being applied to the second variable in a text frame
- Fixed issue with some special characters in text frames
- Fixed Esc key behavior while creating a frame
- Fixed image picker preview not showing for assets that are used for the first time
- Fixed the layout width and height properties in an action now returning the actual layout size
- Fixed use of `null` to remove a prefix or suffix via an action (f.i. `studio.variables.setPrefix("Price", null);`)
