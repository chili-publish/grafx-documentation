![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

## New features

- Get total control over how your design should automatically adapt when the page size changes with the new [anchoring](/GraFx-Studio/guides/anchoring/) feature. You can use the simple controls to set it up, while the frame's anchor lines help you to set the correct offsets.
- With the [layout presets](/GraFx-Studio/guides/layouts/) you can choose from a library of the most common print, social, display, and DOOH formats to quickly create multiple layouts at once.
- The new [Design & Run mode](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/design-run/) lets you easily test your template as an end-user, without leaving the workspace! And you can rest assured you're not messing up your original design while testing it.
