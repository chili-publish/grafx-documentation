## Improvements

- Improved caching for Media and Fonts

## Changes

- Stop support of folders for templates
- Rename 'my projects' to 'projects' in API

## Fixes
- Fix issue with collection rename when environments contain upper case letters


## My Projects to Projects

We have updated all output endpoints to support a new field in the request: projectId.  
V1 Will support both fields to avoid breaking integrations.
