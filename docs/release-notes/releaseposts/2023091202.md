# GraFx Studio

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

- Fixed issue with output generation in both Template Designer workspace and Studio UI
- You can now delete multiple paragraph and character styles, colors, and actions at once

Improvements to **Actions** ([experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) feature):

- An error icon is shown in the list of actions if the action contains errors
- We added more flexibility to get and set properties in an action
- We changed the method name to change the visibility of a frame: `.include()` is replaced by `.setVisible()`  

!!! Warning 
	**This is a breaking change! Please update any template that uses this method ([here](../../../../../GraFx-Studio/guides/actions/example-hideframe/) you can find an example of how it works). Projects created from these templates will also be impacted, so it is advised to delete them and start new projects from the updated templates.**
