CHILI GraFx [Environment API 1.3.3](https://sandbox1.chili-publish-sandbox.online/grafx/swagger/index.html)

## Improvements

- Improved the performance of the 'Get' endpoints for media and templates.
- Transitioned to using a token cache service for fetching internal tokens, moving away from direct calls to the identity provider.
- Standardized the examples in Swagger documentation for consistency.

## Fixes

- Fixed the issue causing a 500 response when certain invalid arguments are used.
- Addressed an issue where URLs containing the 'environment' value in varying case sensitivities caused errors.
- Resolved a 500 error that occurred due to a concurrency issue when executing multiple requests to delete a single folder.
- Fixed a problem where templates became unattachable to any collection after being manually migrated to another environment without updating their ID.

## New Endpoints

- Introduced for Enhanced Media Preview Capabilities<br>`GET /api/v1/environment/{environment}/media/{mediaId}/preview/highestOrVector`
