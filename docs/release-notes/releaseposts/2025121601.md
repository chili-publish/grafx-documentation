# Opacity Import with plugins

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

## ✨ Improved

### GraFx Studio

- **Added opacity import from Adobe® InDesign® and Adobe® Photoshop®.**  
  Object opacity settings defined in the source files are now preserved when importing designs into GraFx Studio.

- **Applies across shapes, text, and images**, including blend mode behavior and multi-layer compositions.

## Why this matters

Designs now retain their intended transparency and visual layering when moving from Adobe tools into GraFx Studio—reducing manual fixes and ensuring more predictable results in templates and automated output.
