# GraFx Studio - GraFx Genie-powered Smart Crop

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

Powered by our AI assistant **GraFx Genie**, CHILI GraFx now instantly identifies the subject and the Point of Interest (POI) within the image then automatically crops it to fit the frame – whether for social media, digital ads, or print.  

And while **Smart Crop** automates precision at scale, you stay in control: You can fine-tune the subject position within the frame, crop manually, or override the image's AI-generated data with your preferred adjustments.

## Smart crop

- GraFx Genie uses a purpose-built AI model to analyze any image to detect the subject and the Point of Interest (POI)
- Use Smart crop as image fit mode to automatically crop any image to fit this subject and POI inside the frame
- Specify the subject position within the frame, f.i. if you want your subject on the left side of the frame because you have text on the right side
- Manually override the image's AI-generated data in GraFx Media if you want to fine-tune the subject and POI (please be aware that this change impacts all templates using this asset!)

## More image fit mode improvements
- There is a new Manual crop mode to manually crop an image and keep that crop for every new image (you always enter this mode when cropping an image)
- When using Fill or Fit mode, you can change the image position, f.i. if you want it to be fitted at the top-left instead of the center of the frame

## User Interface theming
- When integrating Studio UI, you can use a JSON with style properties to customize the font and colors of the user interface
