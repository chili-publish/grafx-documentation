# GraFx Studio – MP4 & GIF batch output

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

Batch output is now available for _all_ output formats. While [PDF](/GraFx-Studio/guides/output/settings/#data-source), [PNG](/GraFx-Studio/guides/output/settings/#data-source_2), and [JPG](/GraFx-Studio/guides/output/settings/#data-source_1) already support this feature, you can now generate [**MP4**](/GraFx-Studio/guides/output/settings/#data-source_4) and [**GIF**](/GraFx-Studio/guides/output/settings/#data-source_3) files in batch as well. Just activate the data source option in your [output settings](/guides/output/settings/) to automatically create a file for each record in your dataset.

We’ve also added **improved error handling** for MP4 and GIF outputs, aligning them with the reliability of our other formats.
