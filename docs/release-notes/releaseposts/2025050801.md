# GraFx Studio – MP4 & GIF batch output

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

Batch output is now available for _all_ output formats. While PDF, PNG, and JPG already support this feature, you can now generate **MP4** and **GIF** files in batch as well. Just activate the data source option in your output settings to automatically create a file for each record in your dataset.

We’ve also added **improved error handling** for MP4 and GIF outputs, aligning them with the reliability of our other formats.
