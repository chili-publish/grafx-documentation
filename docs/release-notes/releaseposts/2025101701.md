### GraFx Studio + Engine
- **Added linear gradient support** for shape frames — enabling richer visual effects.
Including CMYK, RGB, Hex and Spot color support.  
See documentation on [how to apply gradients](/GraFx-Studio/guides/gradients/).  
- **Added option to “Create variables from datasource”** directly in the UI for faster data mapping.  
[See documentation on how to create variables, straight from the datasource](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/define/#create-variables-from-a-linked-datasource).  
- **Added “Prevent line break”** behavior for single-line text variables to preserve layout integrity.  
[See how to set the property for variables](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/single-line-text/#set-general-properties).  
- **Increased Performance** when loading a document.  

### GraFx Genie
- **Raised the max character count** to 4000, allowing for longer prompt input.  

## 🛠️ What's Fixed & Improved

### GraFx Studio

- Fix for **Indic languages**.  
- Fixed **loading a new document** sometimes didn’t load the canvas.  
- Number variable now **blocks non-finite values**.
- Fix for **resizing cursor**: shouldn’t show when hovering frame borders in text edit mode.
- Fixed an issue where **typing “G”** inside focused form elements could show translation keys.  
- **Improved GraFx Genie** to include selected triggers in its context.  
- **Improved GraFx Genie** to prevent circular references.  
- Fixed that **nested folders wouldn’t open** in the variable image picker when a media connector folder path was set.  
- **Number variables now reject non-finite values** (NaN/±∞) from Actions/SDK to avoid JSON save failures.

### GraFx Studio UI

- Fix for scrolling tray component on mobile devices.
