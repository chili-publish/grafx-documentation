## Fixes

- Fixed cache issues when requesting Documents previews.  
Image preview download returns wrong content type instead of image/png when async was set to false.
- Fixed issue where imageQuality property in PDF export settings isn't updated via Backoffice

## Improvements

- PDF generation performance has been improved when no post-processing options are selected in the PDF Export Settings. This is default for new PDF Export Settings.
