# GraFx Studio

Version 0.102.2, using Studio SDK [0.102.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

## Features

- You can now add [swatches](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/) to your Stylekit and use them in your template, e.g. to change the color of your text via a paragraph or character style (ðŸ‘‰ click the color field to open the color picker, where you can go to the swatches tab to select a swatch)
- The [color picker](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/#color-picker) now comes in two versions, one for defining a swatch (where you cannot set the opacity or select another swatch) and one for applying a color (where you can choose between a custom color or a swatch and where you can change the opacity)
- You can [pan and zoom](/GraFx_Studio/mouse_trackpad/) the canvas by using two-finger gestures on the trackpad, even if the Hand or Zoom tool is not selected

## Improvements

- Improved text selection and text cursor positioning
- Simplified the character style settings by removing the indeterminate state for fill color (ðŸ‘‰ when you leave the fill color unchecked the color is not applied, which means the default black or the color from the applied paragraph style is used)
- The default Arial Regular font is always available in the dropdown menu where you can select a font
- Renaming a font in the Stylekit is blocked (ðŸ‘‰ you cannot rename a font in the Stylekit, but this was not blocked and caused an incorrect rename state)
- Removed variable name input field from the variables settings panel (ðŸ‘‰ you can rename a variable by double clicking the variable name in the list)
