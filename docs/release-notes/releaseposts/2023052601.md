# GraFx Studio

Version 0.122.1, using Studio SDK [0.122.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

## Features

- You can [crop an image](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/crop/) to manually resize and position it inside an image frame
- [Snap guides](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/snapping/) show up when creating, moving or resizing a frame to help you to nicely align the frames in your design

## Improvements

- You can use the arrow keys to move a frame in steps of 1 pixel, holding down the Shift key moves it in steps of 10 pixels
- Creating, moving or resizing a frame is now done on a pixel grid, meaning that the x, y, width, and height properties have non-decimal values
- Punctuation marks stay together with the preceding word and will not move to the next line

## Fixes

- Fixed issue where the animation sometimes blinked at the beginning or the end
- Fixed issue where changing the width or height of a frame also caused an override on other properties
- Fixed issue with constraining proportions when changing the width or height of a frame in the properties panel
