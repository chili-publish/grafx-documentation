- **Added character style support for numbered lists.**  
  Character styles now apply consistently within numbered list items.

- **Added keyboard shortcuts for list level control.**  
  You can increase or decrease levels in bullet and numbered lists using keyboard shortcuts.

- **Added predefined formatting for four numbered list levels.**  
  Numbered lists now follow a fixed, predictable structure across up to four levels.

- **Added enforcement of maximum text variable length.**  
  Text variables now respect defined length limits to prevent overflow and layout breaks.

### 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed inconsistent behavior when applying subscript and superscript**  
  across inline, paragraph, and character styles.

- **Fixed text frame content replacement issues**  
  that could result in unexpected text behavior.

- **Fixed aspect ratio restrictions being applied when the object was disabled.**

- **Fixed text frame resizing when auto-grow was enabled.**

- **Fixed incorrect positioning of newly created frames.**

## Studio UI

### ✨ New & Improved

- **Support for image frame constraints**  
  The Studio UI now reflects and enforces image frame constraints defined in GraFx Studio.

### 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed validation when `projectId` is optional**  
  to prevent incorrect parameter errors.

- **Fixed layout shift when a date picker displays an error message.**
