![GraFx Studio icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg){.rn_icon} <span class="version-label">v1.37</span>

## GraFx Studio

### ✨ New & Improved

- **Added constraints for image frames**  
  You can now constrain resizing, movement, and rotation for image frames.

- **Added character style support for numbered lists.**  
  Character style can be applied to number style (format and symbol after number) for numbered list inside paragraph style.

- **Added keyboard shortcuts for list level control.**  
  You can increase or decrease levels in bullet and numbered lists using keyboard shortcuts.

- **Added predefined formatting for four numbered list levels.**  
  Each level now has its own formatting. The fourth level no longer inherits from the first and uses a dedicated number format and symbol.
  
- **Added enforcement of maximum text variable length.**  
  Text variables now respect defined length limits to prevent overflow and layout breaks.

### 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed inconsistent behavior when applying subscript and superscript**  
  across inline, paragraph, and character styles.

- **Fixed text frame content replacement issues**  
  that could result in unexpected text behavior.

- **Fixed aspect ratio restrictions being applied when the object was disabled.**

- **Fixed text frame resizing when auto-grow was enabled.**

- **Fixed incorrect positioning of newly created frames.**

## Studio UI

### ✨ New & Improved

- **Support for image frame constraints**  
  The Studio UI now reflects and enforces image frame constraints defined in GraFx Studio.

### 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed validation when `projectId` is optional**  
  to prevent incorrect parameter errors.

- **Fixed layout shift when a date picker displays an error message.**
