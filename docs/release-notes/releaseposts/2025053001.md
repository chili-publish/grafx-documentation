# GraFx Studio – Image upload

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.25</span>

## ✨ What’s New

### ⬆️ Custom Image Upload

Template designers can allow end-users to upload their own images directly in the Studio UI!
This enables deeper personalization and flexibility for user-generated content, custom branding, and campaign variations.

Currently, you can enable either image browsing or uploading for end-users — soon, you will be able to offer both options simultaneously.

See [Image Variable](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/image/#connector-settings) on how to enable Image Upload in template variables.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements

- Resolved an issue when using a sequence of actions
- Improved load times for large templates
