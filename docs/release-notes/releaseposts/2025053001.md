![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.25</span>

## ✨ What’s New

### ⬆️ Custom Image Upload

Template designers can allow end-users to upload their own images directly in the Studio UI!
This enables deeper personalization and flexibility for user-generated content, custom branding, and campaign variations.

See [Image Variable](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/image/#connector-settings) on how to enable Image Upload in template variables.
