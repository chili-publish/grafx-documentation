## Features

### Output settings

- You can add a watermark to generate free-of-charge output
- In the Template Designer workspace, you can select one of the output settings to export a template

### Print

- PDF output is now available in production
- For each layout in a template, you can specify if the intent is print, digital static, or digital animated
- You only see the panels and properties that are relevant for the selected intent (e.g., the animation panel is only shown when the intent is "digital animated")
- You can set the unit to pixels, millimeters, or inches (this was already available in experimental mode)
- You can set a bleed area when the intent is "print" (only visible on the canvas in normal view mode)
- You can toggle between normal and preview mode with the 'W' shortcut
- In the Studio UI, the play button and animation timeline are only shown when the intent of the selected layout is "digital animated"

### Typography

- You can change the baseline shift of text

## Improvements

- You can select multiple frames and rotate them together
- An image frame is automatically created when clicking an asset in the Media panel (when no image frame is selected)
- The layout properties are shown when clicking the page background (previously, you had to click the layout name above the page)
- Duplicating an image variable now also copies the media connector settings
- The image variable settings are now spread over 3 tabs for a better structure
- The folder setting for image variables can now also be linked to a list variable
- The top left menu is restructured, has more options, and shows the shortcuts
- New shortcuts to open the left panels

- You can now search and sort the list of templates.
- You can switch between grid and list view on the templates page
- Overwrite dialog is shown when you assign an image from the media panel to a frame with an image variable
