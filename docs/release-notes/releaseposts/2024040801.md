## Features

### Output settings

- You can create [output settings](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/output-settings/) for PDF, JPG, PNG, MP4, and GIF output formats
- There are type-specific settings to control scaling, quality, and frame rate
- You can add a watermark to generate free-of-charge output
- In the Template Designer workspace, you can select one of the output settings to export a template

### Print

- PDF output is now available in production
- For each layout in a template, you can specify if the [intent](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/layout-intent/) is print, digital static, or digital animated
- You only see the panels and properties that are relevant for the selected intent (e.g., the animation panel is only shown when the intent is "digital animated")
- You can set the unit to pixels, millimeters, or inches (this was already available in experimental mode)
- You can set a [bleed](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/bleed/) area when the intent is "print" (only visible on the canvas in normal view mode)
- You can [toggle](/GraFx-Studio/overview/hamburger-menu/) between normal and preview mode with the 'W' [shortcut](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/shortcuts/#view)
- In the Studio UI, the play button and animation timeline are only shown when the intent of the selected layout is "digital animated"

### Typography

- You can change the [baseline shift of text](/GraFx-Studio/guides/text-frame/#typographic-properties)

## Improvements

- You can [select multiple frames](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/frames/#select-a-frame) and rotate them together
- An image frame is automatically created when clicking an asset in the Media panel (when no image frame is selected)
- The layout properties are shown when clicking the page background (previously, you had to click the layout name above the page)
- Duplicating an image variable now also copies the media connector settings
- The image variable settings are now spread over 3 tabs for a better structure
- The folder setting for image variables can now also be linked to a list variable
- The top left menu is restructured, has more options, and shows the shortcuts
- New shortcuts to open the left panels
- New shortcuts to save and export a template
- You can now search and sort the list of templates.
- You can switch between grid and list view on the templates page
- Overwrite dialog is shown when you assign an image from the media panel to a frame with an image variable
- A metadata section was added to the image variable settings. It allows using data from image metadata in the templates variables

### Fixes

- Fixed drag and drop issue on Windows devices with a touchscreen
- Fixed output rendering issue when the animation ends with a slide outro
- Fixed issue with media search in the Studio UI when "Include subfolders" is turned off
- Fixed issue with the animation duration input field
- Fixed issue when renaming a template with invalid input
- Fixed tooltip issue on the zoom controls
- Fixed issue with the shape list dialog not automatically closing after one is selected
