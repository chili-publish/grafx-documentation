{==Version: 1.21==}

## GraFx Studio Versioning

Starting with this release, {==GraFx Studio version numbers==} will be clearly referenced.  
You can now **pin your environment to a specific version** or choose to always use the latest version.  
This ensures stability for your templates and integrations while keeping track of when new features were introduced.  
By locking your environment to a specific version, you can maintain compatibility between your templates and GraFx Studio while having the flexibility to upgrade at your own pace.

## Data Connectors

We're introducing **data connectors**, making it easier than ever to connect GraFx Studio to external data sources.  
The first available data connector is **Google Sheets**, allowing you to:

- Link your Google spreadsheet to a template for batch output of all records.
- Navigate through records directly in the **Studio UI** for seamless data exploration.
