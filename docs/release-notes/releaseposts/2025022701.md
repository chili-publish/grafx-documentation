# GraFx Studio 1.21 - Data connectors & GraFx Studio versioning

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

Version `1.21`

## Data Connectors

We’re launching **Data Connectors**, making it easier than ever to connect GraFx Studio to external data sources. The first available data connector is **Google Sheets**, allowing you to:
- Link your Google spreadsheet to a template for batch output of all records.
- Navigate through records directly in the Studio UI for seamless data exploration.

## GraFx Studio Versioning

With **GraFx Studio Versioning**, you can now lock the GraFx Studio SDK to a specific version to ensure compatibility between the templates and your GraFx Studio integration.
