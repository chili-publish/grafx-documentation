# Text columns

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.36</span>

## ✨ New & Improved

- **Added text columns for text frames.**  

You can now split a text frame into **columns** and control the spacing between them.

This makes it easier to build editorial-style layouts and structured text blocks within a single frame, while keeping all existing auto-resize and overflow behavior intact for scalability.

## 🛠️ What's Fixed

- **Fixed character style behavior when no font family is set.**

When a character style has its font family set to **[None]**, the font-style dropdown is now **empty and disabled**.
