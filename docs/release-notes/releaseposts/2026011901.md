## ✨ New & Improved

### Platform

- **Environment settings available at environment level.**  
  Environment-specific settings are now also available via a **gear icon** in the left navigation panel (bottom).

  A new input field in Environment Settings allows you to easily copy the technical name for use in integrations, APIs, and configuration.

- **Updated GraFx Studio versioning display.**  
  Version numbers now follow the format **major.minor.x**, reducing visual noise and focusing on meaningful updates.

## 🛠️ What's Fixed

### Platform

  Users with combined EA and CA roles are now correctly redirected to the template page.

- **Improved template import error handling.**  
  Upload failures during template import now have clearer error reporting.
