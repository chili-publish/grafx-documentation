## Fixes

- When outputting a PDF with a variable in the path name, the value of the variable is now used correctly.
- Fixed the issue where an asset could end up as duplicate using ResourceItemAdd, when a path was malformed.
- Fixed vulnerability where code details were shown in an error message
- Fixed incorrect behavior for the ResourceSearchInFolder API endpoint related to the parentFolderPath parameter. Previously, when includeSubDirectories was set to true, the endpoint performed a prefix search. This behavior has been corrected to conduct an exact search, aligning with expectations set in prior versions of CHILI.
- Fixed issue where some characters in REST endpoint query parameters cause the endpoint to fail

## Improvements

- A download will now be served from a more sustainable location
- Improved performance when copying a file with an existing name
