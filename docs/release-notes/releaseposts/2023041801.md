# GraFx Publisher

**Boost Platform Performance**

GraFx Publisher comes with more than just a name change, this year it is all about improving platform performance. We've listened to your feedback and revamped our platform infrastructure to deliver blazing-fast file operations, including moving, copying, and deleting. This means you can work efficiently even in large environments! 🚀

Note: Smaller environments might not notice significant changes in performance.

🔔 Heads up: We've fine-tuned the ResourceItemGetTree and ResourceItemGetTreeLevel API endpoints to optimize performance. Now, these endpoints return only the first 10,000 items, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.

## Fixes

- API: Fixed issue with ResourceSearchInFolder not returning items in response if includeSubDirectories property was false
- API: Fixed 'ResourceGetTree/ResourceGetTreeLevel' for enabled support 'parentFolder' argument ending with slashes.
- API: Fixed 'rest-api/v1/resources/documents/items/{id}/privateinfo' endpoint to return 'fileInfo.xml' node
