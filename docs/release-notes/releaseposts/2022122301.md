# GraFx Studio

Version 0.97.1, using Studio SDK [0.97.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

## Improvements

- You can leave the color of your character style undefined to use the color from the applied paragraph style
- After creating a text or image frame, you now automatically go back to the Select tool

## Fixes

- Fixed issue with loading fonts, which caused the default font to be used instead (ℹ️ because of this fix the text in your template can look different)
- The editor canvas is no longer moving when opening or closing the left side panel
