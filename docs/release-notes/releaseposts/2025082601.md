# GraFx Studio UI â€“ Upload and Browse assets

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.29</span>

## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s New

### Upload and Browse assets simultaneously

End users can now both [upload and browse assets through Image Variables](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/image/#connector-settings).

This feature is active for GraFx Media. 
Template designers can configure image variables to support both browse and upload functionalities. 
Directories in GraFx Media for upload and browsing can both be configured for the same variable.
