# CHILI GraFx 

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-04.svg)

## Features

- De-activate a user so the user can no longer access or use any of the resources within that subscription
- Re-activate a user that was deactivated so the user has exactly the same priviliges he had before being de-activated
- Delete a user so the user loses all his privileges within that subscription & the user isn't visible in the list of users anymore

## Improvements

- GET /subscription/id and /subscription/id/renders were migrated to use GUIDs. Now all our endpoints use GUIDs for identifying entities.
- GET subscription/subscriptionId/users/userId has been deprecated to improve consistency in naming. GET subscription**s**/subscriptionId/users/userId is the new endpoint.
