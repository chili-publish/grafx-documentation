# GraFx Publisher

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

- User management in GraFx Publisher has changed to API User management. You are now able to manage GraFx Publisher [users in CHILI GraFx platform](/CHILI-GraFx/users/creation/). Existing users in GraFx Publisher are unaffected, but we advise migrating these users to [CHILI GraFx](/CHILI-GraFx/users/creation/).
- Fixed an issue in the DEL ‘/rest-api/v1.2/resources/Documents/folders’ endpoint to prevent data loss.
