# GraFx Studio

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

With this release, we introduced improvements to the GraFx Studio Smart Template editor

- You're now able to reorder actions (this impacts the order of execution when multiple actions have the same trigger)

- Action script is saved even if it contains errors (indicated with a red squiggly line). This is useful when you're in the middle of writing an action and you need to close the action interface to check something

- Visual improvements to the action interface
- Rename action trigger to "Selected layout changed"
- Force action names to be unique
- Show notification when closing or reloading GraFx Studio with unsaved changes
- When inserting an image variable in an image frame that contains an image, this image is automatically set as default state for that image variable
- Dialog to edit a character/paragraph style is not hidden behind the animation timeline anymore
- Fixed issue with error tooltips
- Add percentage sign behind line height value
- Selecting another layout exits text editing mode
- It's no longer possible to use a URL for an image variable (an asset ID must be used)

We also improved the GraFx Studio UI, the interface for the self-service use-case

- Automatically zoom to page when another layout is selected by an action
- Shortcuts to select another tool are disabled to prevent end-users from accidentally going into inline edit mode
- Shortcut to open the debug panel is disabled
- Show indicator and block new downloads while download is in progress
