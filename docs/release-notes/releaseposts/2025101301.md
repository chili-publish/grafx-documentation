## ✨ New & Improved

### GraFx Studio + Engine
- **Added linear gradient support** for shape frames — enabling richer visual effects.  
- **Added support for bullet lists** in paragraph style configuration — making it easier to format text consistently across templates.  
- **Added option to “Create variables from datasource”** directly in the UI for faster data mapping.  
- **Added “Do not break”** behavior for single-line text variables to preserve layout integrity.  

### GraFx Genie
- **GraFx Genie graduates from experimental mode** and now uses the production endpoint for all actions — delivering faster, more stable results.

### Platform & Infrastructure
- **Substituted use of PAT with GitHub Access Token**, enhancing security for internal builds.  
- **Run PR builds on self-hosted runners** for improved CI reliability.  
- **Dependency update:** Vite bumped from 5.4.19 → 5.4.20.
