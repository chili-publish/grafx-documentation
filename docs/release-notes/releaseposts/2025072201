## ✨ What’s New
---
### 🖼️ GraFx Brand Kits
Define your whole visual identity once—colors, fonts, images, styles—and apply it everywhere in GraFx Studio for lightning-fast, on-brand templates.  

### ✍️ Text & Fonts
* **Text stroke.** Add crisp outlines with rounded joins, perfectly rendered in editor and PDF.  
* **Indic-language support.** Noto Sans Devanagari (and friends) now parses without issues.

### ⚡ Designer Productivity
* **Sticky variable settings.** Rename variables without losing the settings panel.

### 🔧 Under the Hood
* Translatable strings auto-extracted from templates.  
* Canvas repaint refactor for smoother visuals.  
---
### 🐛 Fixes & Polish
* Name always included on **Save As**.  
* Stroked text keeps its position in PDFs.  
* No orphan style refs after **Undo**.  
* Template previews now consistently match final output.  
* Various performance improvements and other bug fixes.
