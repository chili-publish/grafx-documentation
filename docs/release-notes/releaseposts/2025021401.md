# GraFxÂ Studio - Visibility conditions for variables

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

With visibility conditions, you can easily define when a variable should be visible to the user in Studio UI. It's a simple interface where you can add conditions, based on the selected layout or a specific variable value.

## New Studio UI controls to select and resize a layout

- When you make a layout available, it shows up in a layout selector for the user
- When you make a layout resizable, the user will get width and height inputs to change the page size
- You can restrict the resizing by specifying a minimum and maximum width and height
- With the layout display name, you can change the name of the layout as it is presented to the user

!!! note "Variable visibility functions in actions are deprecated"

    With the introduction of visibility conditions for variables, we are deprecating all 'setVisible' and 'isVisible' action functions. This way, the visibility conditions act as one source of truth. It's also easier to set up.
