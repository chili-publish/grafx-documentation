We are working hard on delivering an end-to-end process, from Smart Templates created by designers to output generated by end users. Check out the [template management](/CHILI-GraFx/concepts/template-management/) page to learn more about this new way of working.

The first step in this process is organizing your templates in [collections](/CHILI-GraFx/guides/manage-collections/). This is available now!

In the next step, end users will be able to browse the collections and start a project from one of the templates. The project will be opened in a user-friendly interface where you can make changes and generate output.
