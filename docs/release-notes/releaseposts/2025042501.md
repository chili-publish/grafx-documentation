![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

In addition to PDF, you can now generate **PNG** and **JPG** files in batch. Simply enable the data source option in the output settings, and an image file will be created for each record in your dataset.

This update also brings **improved error handling** for PNG and JPG outputs, consistent with our existing PDF error handling—making your batch exports more reliable than ever.
