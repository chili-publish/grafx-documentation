# GraFx Studio adds date variables

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-10.svg)

With date variables, an end user can select a date via an easy-to-use date picker, which is then displayed on the design in the format and language, as specified by the template designer.

Want to localize your output? No problem, with actions you can change the date format and language based on the targetted region!

And, of course, the date can also be set via API, if you want to feed the template with data from an external system.

Want to know how it works? Check out the [documentation](/GraFx-Studio/guides/template-variables/date/).
