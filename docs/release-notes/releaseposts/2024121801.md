# GraFx Studio - Multi-page & Auto-grow

![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

We’re excited to announce another milestone update for GraFx Studio, introducing **multi-page templates** and **auto-grow text frames**!  

This update also includes display names for variables and enhanced error handling for missing fonts, along with other usability improvements.  

<!-- more -->

## New features

### Multi-page Templates
- Create templates with multiple pages for print layouts
- Hide or show pages as needed – only visible pages appear in the Studio UI and in PDF output
- Seamlessly combine print and digital layouts into one multi-channel template

See [documentation](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/pages/)

### Auto-grow Text Frames
- Enable text frames to automatically grow or shrink based on content while maintaining a fixed font size
- Anchor other frames to maintain consistent spacing

### Customizable Variable Display Names
- Use the new variable label property to customize how variables appear in the Studio UI, improving clarity for end-users

### Missing Fonts Error Handling
- When a font is missing from GraFx Fonts, a clear error message now appears in the template designer workspace
- The error includes a list of all missing fonts, streamlining troubleshooting

### GraFx Studio importer
- Import a ZIP package to convert an InDesign document to a GraFx Studio template
- The InDesign plugin will be available soon!

## Improvements

- Cropped images are no longer stretched when the frame is resized (this improvement can have an impact on existing designs)
- A redesigned Resources panel in the template designer workspace now groups all resources in one place, offering a cleaner and more organized user experience
- Improved handling of long names in the template designer workspace

## Fixes

- Fixed issue where variables could not be inserted into newly created text frames
