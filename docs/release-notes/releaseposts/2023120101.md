## Improvements

- The panels for editing actions or selecting images/fonts can now be freely moved without obstructing workspace interaction
- The Template Designer workspace is now fully integrated into the CHILI GraFx platform using the same domain, eliminating the need for occasional re-logins due to the studio.chiligrafx.com domain change

## Fixes

- Fixed occasional images flicker during animation playback
- The text frame in animations now correctly displays the changed variable value when modified with an action
- Server-side rendering no longer utilizes incorrect layouts when actions alter the layout
- Duplicating a variable group now includes duplicating the associated variables
- Fixed rendering issues for certain fonts
