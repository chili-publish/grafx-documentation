## Improvements

- The panels for editing actions or selecting images/fonts can now be freely moved without obstructing workspace interaction

- The text frame in animations now correctly displays the changed variable value when modified with an action
- Server-side rendering no longer utilizes incorrect layouts when actions alter the layout
- Duplicating a variable group now includes duplicating the associated variables
- Fixed rendering issues for certain fonts
