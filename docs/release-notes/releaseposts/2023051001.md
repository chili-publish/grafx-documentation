# GraFx Studio SDK

We renamed our repository and package for the SDK.
The new name is studio-sdk, coming from editor-sdk.

Also a new version has been pushed, we're now at version 0.121.0

??? note "Note for integrators"

	This means you'll have to update your integration dependency, and change it from @chili-publish/editor-sdk to @chili-publish/studio-sdk inside your `package.json`.
