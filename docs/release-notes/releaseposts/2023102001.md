GraFx Studio, GraFx Fonts & GraFx Media go live!

<!-- more -->

## GraFx Media

GraFx Media is the application on CHILI GraFx that enables you to manage template assets in one central library. Assets in GraFx Media are shared across GraFx Studio & GraFx Publisher. Asset management for GraFx Publisher can still be done in GraFx Publisher but with GraFx Media we offer an improved UX to manage assets more efficiently.

### Features
- You can upload an asset with format .eps, .jpg, .pdf, .png, .psd, .tif & .ai
- You can create folders
- You can rename or delete an asset
- You can filter on format of assets

## GraFx Fonts

GraFx Fonts introduces the concept of font families & font styles to CHILI GraFx and brings better brand consistency to CHILI GraFx. Important to know is that fonts in GraFx Fonts can only be used in GraFx Studio. Fonts used in GraFx Publisher are managed in GraFx Publisher separately. 

### Features
- You can upload a font style & font family
- During the font upload you can change the font family and font style
- You can sort & delete font styles & font families
- You can access font styles details

## GraFx Studio

This is a big day for GraFx Studio, as it is now available for use in production!

Managing templates and collections and access to the Template Designer workspace are now restricted to admins and template designers. Other users can use templates to create projects with personalized and localized content, but cannot edit the original templates.

Even though it is now in production, GraFx Studio renders are not yet counted, as we want to give our users some time to get used to the new application first. We hope you enjoy it and are curious to hear your feedback!

### Features

**Actions**

Actions can be added to a template to define how it should react to user input. Actions let you show/hide a frame or variable, select a layout, change a variable value, change a color, and much more. Triggers can be set to control when actions should be executed.

It was already available as an [experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) feature but is now available for production use.

**GraFx Fonts**

With the introduction of GraFx Fonts, we also introduce the concept of font families and font styles in GraFx Studio. You can now add font families to the Stylekit of your template and the font styles from this family will be available for use in the template.

**This is a breaking change!** All existing templates need to be updated (GraFx Publisher fonts are not accessible anymore through GraFx Studio and will fall back to Arial). This means you have to upload your fonts to GraFx Fonts, add them to the Stylekit of your template, and apply them again to the text and/or styles. Projects created from these templates are also impacted, it is advised to delete them and start new projects from the updated templates.

**Image variable settings**

Inside the image variable settings, the template designer can specify the folder inside GraFx Media where the assets for that variable are located. This results in a better experience for the user and prevents access to other assets.

For custom media connectors this also enables custom settings for image variables, as defined by the connector. Custom media connectors enable you to use assets from an external DAM system in GraFx Studio templates (this is still in [experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) mode).

### Improvements

- Writing actions has been made easier with the introduction of [helper functions](../../../../../GraFx-Studio/concepts/helper-functions/)
- Renamed triggers that are used inside the action script (**This is a breaking change!** Please update any action that uses triggers.changedVariable, triggers.changedFrame, etc.)
- Improved error indications in the list of actions
- Proper support for undo/redo of actions
- Improved visual feedback on the canvas when an image is unable to load
- UI improvements in the Template Designer workspace
- UI improvements in the Studio UI
- When integrating the Studio UI you can configure the download and back buttons

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with undo/redo and saving of changes to horizontal text alignment
