![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg) <span class="version-label">v1.35</span>

## ✨ New & Improved

### GraFx Studio + Engine

- **Added numbered lists in paragraph styles**  
  Define and apply multi-level numbered lists with configurable formats, symbols, and indents.

- **Improved bullet list icon rendering with character styles**  
  Bullet icons now correctly reflect the font defined in the assigned character style.  
  If no character style is assigned, or if its font is set to *None*, bullets fall back to the paragraph style font.

- **Improved error handling during Studio loading**  
  When global configuration or load issues occur (for example, when the engine cannot be loaded), Studio now informs users with a clear in-app message.

- **Added `onLoadError` event for integrators**  
  Integrators can now listen for load failures and inspect what went wrong during Studio startup (for example, engine load issues).

- **Added configuration validation for non-TypeScript integrations**  
  For integrations not using TypeScript, parts of the configuration object are now validated at startup. If validation fails, Studio loading is blocked and the issue is reported via browser alert and console output.
