## Features

New action item ‘Collection settings’ was added to collections. This panel can be opened in two ways:
- Through the "Three dots" on the collection card and clicking "Collection settings"
- Inside a collection by clicking on the "Three dots" in the top right corner.

It opens a panel with ‘Cover image’ option which allows to upload image that is shown on the collection card. For the uploaded image PNG, JPG and JPEG formats can be used and we don’t have restrictions for a file size.

## Fixes
- Fixed issue where a template could be opened as a project from ‘Collection’ tab. Now a template can be opened only from the ‘My projects’ tab
