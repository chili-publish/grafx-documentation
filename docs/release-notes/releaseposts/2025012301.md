## New features

- Export a single page or all pages from a single layout  
Exported pages will have equal sizes. If pages have different sizes, the user can choose to skip pages with different sizes or have the plugin convert them to the size of the first page.  
A limitation of maximum 50 pages per export has been set. Pages beyond the 50th will not be exported.

## Improvements

- Optimized the preflight process.
- Fixed a bug related to frame position conversion that could prevent the import into GraFx Studio.
