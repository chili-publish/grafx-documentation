![rn_icon](/assets/icon-GraFx-Studio.svg)

Convert Multi-page documents from [Adobe® InDesign® plugin](/GraFx-Studio/convert/Adobe-InDesign/)

Available as [experimental](/release-notes/experimental/), you can seamlessly convert them into GraFx Studio templates.

<!-- more -->

## New features

- Added support to export all pages (max 50) from a single layout  
See [this page](/GraFx-Studio/convert/Adobe-InDesign/#export-to-grafx-studio) for more information.

## Improvements

- Optimized the preflight process.
- Fixed a bug related to frame position conversion that could prevent the import into GraFx Studio.

## Known issues

- If any changes are made - while the exporter is open - to the number of layouts or pages in your InDesign document, you should manually select the desired export option in the Plugin 'Export Pages' dropdown menu, even if the correct option was previously selected. Failure to do so may result in the incorrect number of exported pages by the Plugin.
- All 'superscript' text is converted to 'subscript' after exporting to Studio.
