## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s New

### Form Builder configuration in User Interfaces

Template designers now have full control over the form layout shown in **My Projects**.

This enhancement lets you define which input panels are visible to end users and how they are labeled. It's part of the **User Interface** configuration for each Layout Intent.

Key capabilities include:

- Toggle visibility of **Data Sources**, **Layouts**, and **Variables** sections  
- Customize section titles and optional help text  
- Enable or disable the **Layout selector** and **Layout resizing** options  
- Preview how these changes affect the **My Projects** experience for end users
