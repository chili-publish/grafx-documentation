![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

We are working hard on delivering an end-to-end process, from Smart Templates created by designers to output generated by end users. Check out the [template management](/CHILI-GraFx/concepts/template-management/) page to learn more about this new way of working.

The first step in this process is organizing your templates in [collections](/CHILI-GraFx/guides/manage-collections/). This is available now!

In the next step, end users will be able to browse the collections and start a project from one of the templates. The project will be opened in a user-friendly interface where you can make changes and generate output.

## May 31, 2023 - CHILI GraFx

### Added Endpoints

User is able to **rename** template attached to collection

- DELETE /api/v1/templates/{templateId}

Http **method** is changed from ‘PUT’ to ‘PATCH’.

The endpoint now allows partial update of template collection instead of full update.

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)


### Improvements

- When applying a blend mode to a text frame you automatically go out of text edit mode (this way you can see the effect of the blend mode, because it is not applied while in text edit mode)

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with MacBook being detected as a mobile device, causing issues with frame handles
- Fixed issue with opacity not being applied to fill and stroke for shapes

- Fixed issue with text not being selectable with the Text tool when a blend mode is applied to the text frame

??? note "Note for integrators"
	
	There is a minor breaking change in the Studio SDK's typings.
	It basically boils down to changing the import for the Id type, you can do it as follows:<br>
	Change `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/studio-sdk/lib/types/CommonTypes'`<br>
	To `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/studio-sdk'`<br>
	For more information, please check out the [SDK release notes](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases/tag/0.117.0){target="_blank"}.


## Apr 18, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

**Boost Platform Performance**

GraFx Publisher comes with more than just a name change, this year it is all about improving platform performance. We've listened to your feedback and revamped our platform infrastructure to deliver blazing-fast file operations, including moving, copying, and deleting. This means you can work efficiently even in large environments! 🚀

Note: Smaller environments might not notice significant changes in performance.

🔔 Heads up: We've fine-tuned the ResourceItemGetTree and ResourceItemGetTreeLevel API endpoints to optimize performance. Now, these endpoints return only the first 10,000 items, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

### Fixes

- API: Fixed issue with ResourceSearchInFolder not returning items in response if includeSubDirectories property was false
- API: Fixed 'ResourceGetTree/ResourceGetTreeLevel' for enabled support 'parentFolder' argument ending with slashes.
- API: Fixed 'rest-api/v1/resources/documents/items/{id}/privateinfo' endpoint to return 'fileInfo.xml' node
