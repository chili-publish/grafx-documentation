## Oct 20, 2023 - We go live!

GraFx Studio, GraFx Fonts & GraFx Media go live!

### GraFx Media

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-11.svg)

GraFx Media is the application on CHILI GraFx that enables you to manage template assets in one central library. Assets in GraFx Media are shared across GraFx Studio & GraFx Publisher. Asset management for GraFx Publisher can still be done in GraFx Publisher but with GraFx Media we offer an improved UX to manage assets more efficiently.

#### Features
- You can upload an asset with format .eps, .jpg, .pdf, .png, .psd, .tif & .ai
- You can create folders
- You can rename or delete an asset
- You can filter on format of assets

### GraFx Fonts

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-07.svg)

GraFx Fonts introduces the concept of font families & font styles to CHILI GraFx and brings better brand consistency to CHILI GraFx. Important to know is that fonts in GraFx Fonts can only be used in GraFx Studio. Fonts used in GraFx Publisher are managed in GraFx Publisher separately. 

#### Features
- You can upload a font style & font family
- During the font upload you can change the font family and font style
- You can sort & delete font styles & font families
- You can access font styles details

![2023-10-11_15-31-50](https://github.com/chili-publish/grafx-documentation/assets/122599725/fe98f3c4-6b13-4264-aa74-862cd3a35b2f)

### GraFx Studio

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

This is a big day for GraFx Studio, as it is now available for use in production!

Managing templates and collections and access to the Template Designer workspace are now restricted to admins and template designers. Other users can use templates to create projects with personalized and localized content, but cannot edit the original templates.

Even though it is now in production, GraFx Studio renders are not yet counted, as we want to give our users some time to get used to the new application first. We hope you enjoy it and are curious to hear your feedback!

#### Features

**Actions**

Actions can be added to a template to define how it should react to user input. Actions let you show/hide a frame or variable, select a layout, change a variable value, change a color, and much more. Triggers can be set to control when actions should be executed.

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/cddytrgebt.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:55.42% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_cddytrgebt seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>


It was already available as an [experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) feature but is now available for production use.

**GraFx Fonts**

With the introduction of GraFx Fonts, we also introduce the concept of font families and font styles in GraFx Studio. You can now add font families to the Stylekit of your template and the font styles from this family will be available for use in the template.

**This is a breaking change!** All existing templates need to be updated (GraFx Publisher fonts are not accessible anymore through GraFx Studio and will fall back to Arial). This means you have to upload your fonts to GraFx Fonts, add them to the Stylekit of your template, and apply them again to the text and/or styles. Projects created from these templates are also impacted, it is advised to delete them and start new projects from the updated templates.

**Image variable settings**

Inside the image variable settings, the template designer can specify the folder inside GraFx Media where the assets for that variable are located. This results in a better experience for the user and prevents access to other assets.

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ykn7900oei.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:55.42% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ykn7900oei seo=false videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>


For custom media connectors this also enables custom settings for image variables, as defined by the connector. Custom media connectors enable you to use assets from an external DAM system in GraFx Studio templates (this is still in [experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) mode).

#### Improvements

- Writing actions has been made easier with the introduction of [helper functions](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/helper-functions/)
- Renamed triggers that are used inside the action script (**This is a breaking change!** Please update any action that uses triggers.changedVariable, triggers.changedFrame, etc.)
- Improved error indications in the list of actions
- Proper support for undo/redo of actions
- Improved visual feedback on the canvas when an image is unable to load
- UI improvements in the Template Designer workspace
- UI improvements in the Studio UI
- When integrating the Studio UI you can configure the download and back buttons

#### Fixes

- Fixed issue with undo/redo and saving of changes to horizontal text alignment

## Sep 19, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

- Output: Improve error handling of a corrupt PNG during output

## Sep 12, 2023 - GraFx Studio

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

- Fixed issue with output generation in both Template Designer workspace and Studio UI
- You can now delete multiple paragraph and character styles, colors, and actions at once

Improvements to **Actions** ([experimental](/release-notes/experimental/) feature):

- An error icon is shown in the list of actions if the action contains errors
- We added more flexibility to get and set properties in an action
- We changed the method name to change the visibility of a frame: `.include()` is replaced by `.setVisible()`  
**This is a breaking change! Please update any template that uses this method ([here](/GraFx-Studio/guides/actions/example-hideframe/) you can find an example of how it works). Projects created from these templates will also be impacted, so it is advised to delete them and start new projects from the updated templates.**

## Sep 12, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

### Fixes

- Fixed failing document preview because of failing preflight checks if a required variable is empty

## Aug 30, 2023 - GraFx Studio

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

With this release, we introduced improvements to the GraFx Studio Smart Template editor

- You're now able to reorder actions (this impacts the order of execution when multiple actions have the same trigger) 

![releasenotes](reorder-actions.gif)

- Action script is saved even if it contains errors (indicated with a red squiggly line). This is useful when you're in the middle of writing an action and you need to close the action interface to check something

![releasenotes](save-on-error.png)

- Visual improvements to the action interface
- Rename action trigger to "Selected layout changed"
- Force action names to be unique
- Show notification when closing or reloading GraFx Studio with unsaved changes
- When inserting an image variable in an image frame that contains an image, this image is automatically set as default state for that image variable
- Dialog to edit a character/paragraph style is not hidden behind the animation timeline anymore
- Fixed issue with error tooltips
- Add percentage sign behind line height value
- Selecting another layout exits text editing mode
- It's no longer possible to use a URL for an image variable (an asset ID must be used)

We also improved the GraFx Studio UI, the interface for the self-service use-case

- Automatically zoom to page when another layout is selected by an action
- Shortcuts to select another tool are disabled to prevent end-users from accidentally going into inline edit mode
- Shortcut to open the debug panel is disabled
- Show indicator and block new downloads while download is in progress


## Aug 30, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

- User management in GraFx Publisher has changed to API User management. You are now able to manage GraFx Publisher [users in CHILI GraFx platform](/CHILI-GraFx/users/creation/). Existing users in GraFx Publisher are unaffected, but we advise migrating these users to [CHILI GraFx](/CHILI-GraFx/users/creation/).
- Fixed an issue in the DEL ‘/rest-api/v1.2/resources/Documents/folders’ endpoint to prevent data loss.

We are working hard on delivering an end-to-end process, from Smart Templates created by designers to output generated by end users. Check out the [template management](/CHILI-GraFx/concepts/template-management/) page to learn more about this new way of working.

The first step in this process is organizing your templates in [collections](/CHILI-GraFx/guides/manage-collections/). This is available now!

In the next step, end users will be able to browse the collections and start a project from one of the templates. The project will be opened in a user-friendly interface where you can make changes and generate output.

Version 0.122.1, using Studio SDK [0.122.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

### Features

- You can [crop an image](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/crop/) to manually resize and position it inside an image frame
- [Snap guides](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/snapping/) show up when creating, moving or resizing a frame to help you to nicely align the frames in your design

![screenshot-fullwidth](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/crop/rectcrop.png)

![screenshot-fullwidth](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/snapping/snapping.gif)

### Improvements

- You can use the arrow keys to move a frame in steps of 1 pixel, holding down the Shift key moves it in steps of 10 pixels
- Creating, moving or resizing a frame is now done on a pixel grid, meaning that the x, y, width, and height properties have non-decimal values
- Punctuation marks stay together with the preceding word and will not move to the next line

### Fixes

- Fixed issue where the animation sometimes blinked at the beginning or the end
- Fixed issue where changing the width or height of a frame also caused an override on other properties
- Fixed issue with constraining proportions when changing the width or height of a frame in the properties panel

## May 23, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

Version 0.117.1, using Studio SDK [0.117.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)


### Improvements

- When applying a blend mode to a text frame you automatically go out of text edit mode (this way you can see the effect of the blend mode, because it is not applied while in text edit mode)
- You can now easily download the JSON file of the template with a "Download doc" trigger in the debug panel

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with MacBook being detected as a mobile device, causing issues with frame handles
- Fixed issue with opacity not being applied to fill and stroke for shapes

- Fixed issue with text not being selectable with the Text tool when a blend mode is applied to the text frame

??? note "Note for integrators"
	
	There is a minor breaking change in the Studio SDK's typings.
	It basically boils down to changing the import for the Id type, you can do it as follows:<br>
	Change `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/studio-sdk/lib/types/CommonTypes'`<br>
	To `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/studio-sdk'`<br>
	For more information, please check out the [SDK release notes](https://github.com/chili-publish/studio-sdk/releases/tag/0.117.0){target="_blank"}.


## Apr 18, 2023 - GraFx Publisher

**Boost Platform Performance**

GraFx Publisher comes with more than just a name change, this year it is all about improving platform performance. We've listened to your feedback and revamped our platform infrastructure to deliver blazing-fast file operations, including moving, copying, and deleting. This means you can work efficiently even in large environments! 🚀

Note: Smaller environments might not notice significant changes in performance.

🔔 Heads up: We've fine-tuned the ResourceItemGetTree and ResourceItemGetTreeLevel API endpoints to optimize performance. Now, these endpoints return only the first 10,000 items, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.

![rn_icon](/assets/CHILI_publisher_RGB.svg)

### Fixes

- API: Fixed issue with ResourceSearchInFolder not returning items in response if includeSubDirectories property was false
- API: Fixed 'ResourceGetTree/ResourceGetTreeLevel' for enabled support 'parentFolder' argument ending with slashes.
- API: Fixed 'rest-api/v1/resources/documents/items/{id}/privateinfo' endpoint to return 'fileInfo.xml' node
