### My CHILI Publisher

My CHILI publisher — MyCP in short — **was** the web portal you can use to manage your subscriptions and environments.

This functionality has been transfered to [CHILI GraFx](/CHILI-GraFx/).

### CHILI publish converters

CHILI publisher, now GraFx Publisher is a smart template editor to allow end-users to interact with your document in a controlled (on-brand) way. GraFx Publisher lives at the end of the workflow, starting from the Smart Template phase.

Concept > Design > Layout > (corporate) Approval > Smart Template > End-user interaction

You’ll need a way to convert your existing documents from your current (desktop) Document Editor into GraFx Publisher.

Once in GraFx Publisher, you can add Document Intelligence, brand guidelines and other rules to allow end-users to interact with your document.
