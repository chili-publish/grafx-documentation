# Convert Desktop files to CHILI GraFx

CHILI GraFx hosts Smart Template Editors to work on (animated) digital and print Smart Templates.
These smart templates live at the end of the workflow.

Concept > Design > Layout > (corporate) Approval > Smart Template > End-user interaction

Youâ€™ll need a way to convert your existing documents from your current (desktop) Document Editor into GraFx Publisher.

Once in the CHILI GraFx editors, you can add Document Intelligence, brand guidelines and other rules to allow end-users to interact with your document.

To enable this conversion, we offer several Extensions or Plugins for existing applications

- GraFx Publisher Converter (for Adobe InDesign)
- GraFx Publisher Data Manager
- GraFx Publisher Live Preflight
- GraFx Publisher AI Converter (for Adobe Illustrator)
