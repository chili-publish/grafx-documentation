## How to access Converter?

You can find the GraFx Publisher converter in Adobe® InDesign® under the "Window" menu.

There are two ways of working: online and offline.
When working offline the conversion of the document will happen locally and the end result will be a GraFx Publisher Package file [.zip] saved to your local drive.

This file will contain the converted document as well as all the images and fonts used in the document. This file will be uploaded to GraFx Publisher in a later stage.

When working online, a direct connection is made. To do that you specify the link to the server, the environment where you want to upload the document, and a username and password.

Once logged in you are presented with a similar interface as when working offline. If you are logged in as an admin you are still able to select another environment if necessary.
In this mode, the converted file, images and fonts will be uploaded immediately to the server after conversion.

Working in online modus also offers you the possibility to convert a GraFx Publisher document back to InDesign® via the "Export to InDesign®" panel.

## How to change the settings for the conversion of locked layers and images. 

With the installation of the converter 3 PDF presets are configured in Adobe® InDesign® as well, that control the conversion to PDF of locked layers and images.

The default presets are tested and guaranteed to work with GraFx Publisher and we offer full support for these.
You're welcome to change the settings at your own risk. Changes to these default settings are beyond our responsibility.

## Adobe PDF Presets

**Converter - Images**: This preset defines the settings for the conversion to pdf of images used in the InDesign® file (tiff, eps, psd, ai). GraFx Publisher supports these type of files natively as well, but when the conversion is done, images are optimized according to their dimensions used in the document (300dpi, at placed dimensions).

**Converter - Locked Layers High Res**: This preset defines the settings for the conversion to pdf of locked layers when the checkbox "Use high resolutions for Locked Layers" is selected.

**Converter - Locked Layers Low Res**: This preset defines the settings for the conversion to pdf of locked layers
