GraFx Studio (Alpha) is an early version of our new template editor.

With GraFx Studio (Alpha), we are working on a whole new creative automation experience that focuses on intuitive UX, high performance, and easy integration.  

Interested in creating animated web banners at scale? That’s the main focus of development right now. And it’s already packing a punch, so check it out! 

!!! Info 
	Please note that GraFx Studio (Alpha) is still in development. Some features are currently missing, and you’ll see a lot of additions and changes as we regularly update the app over the coming months. But if you don't want to miss out on the app’s progress, or if you want to start building your own custom integrations, feel free to get started with GraFx Studio (Alpha) today!
