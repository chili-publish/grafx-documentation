### Corner radius

Rectangle: corner radius can be set per corner individually → 4 properties, 1 for each corner

Polygon: corner radius is the same for all corners → 1 property for all corners

The Default corner radius is 0.

Same for each corner (on by default) → enabling this checkbox will sync all 4 corner radius values.
