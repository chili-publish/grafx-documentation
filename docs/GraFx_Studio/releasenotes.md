## January 30, 2023

Version 0.104.1, using Studio SDK [0.104.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

### Fixes

## January 23, 2023

Version 0.102.2, using Studio SDK [0.102.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

### Features

- You can now add [swatches](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/) to your Stylekit and use them in your template, e.g. to change the color of your text via a paragraph or character style (üëâ click the color field to open the color picker, where you can go to the swatches tab to select a swatch)
- The [color picker](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/#color-picker) now comes in two versions, one for defining a swatch (where you cannot set the opacity or select another swatch) and one for applying a color (where you can choose between a custom color or a swatch and where you can change the opacity)
- You can [pan and zoom](/GraFx_Studio/mouse_trackpad/) the canvas by using two-finger gestures on the trackpad, even if the Hand or Zoom tool is not selected

### Improvements

- Improved text selection and text cursor positioning
- Simplified the character style settings by removing the indeterminate state for fill color (üëâ when you leave the fill color unchecked the color is not applied, which means the default black or the color from the applied paragraph style is used)
- The default Arial Regular font is always available in the dropdown menu where you can select a font
- Renaming a font in the Stylekit is blocked (üëâ you cannot rename a font in the Stylekit, but this was not blocked and caused an incorrect rename state)
- Removed variable name input field from the variables settings panel (üëâ you can rename a variable by double clicking the variable name in the list)
