# CHILI Editor SDK (from npm)

Now weâ€™ve set up the structure, we can start building the integration.
To start we add the Editor SDK as a dependency to our project.

```
npm install --save @chili-publish/editor-sdk
```

!!! note
    Mind, we did NOT add **--save-dev** but only **--save**, since the SDK will be included in the final build as dependency.
