# Use of AI in CHILI GraFx

CHILI GraFx uses artificial intelligence to support creative automation workflows. AI is embedded in specific parts of the platform where it helps reduce manual work and improve consistency. It is not a standalone product and it does not operate independently of user-defined rules, templates, or constraints.

## Where AI is used

AI is applied selectively and always in support of existing platform capabilities. Current use cases include, but are not limited to:

- Design assistance
- Smart template creation
- Code generation for template business logic
- Image annotation and detection

AI augments workflows.

## What AI does not do

AI in CHILI GraFx has clear boundaries:

- It does not act autonomously
- It does not publish or approve content
- It does not bypass template constraints or brand rules
- It does not make creative, legal, or business decisions

All outputs remain under user control.

## Data usage and training

- Customer data is only processed to deliver the Services
- Customer data is **not** used to train, enrich, or improve AI models for any other purpose
- There is no cross-customer data usage
- There is no reuse of customer data outside the scope of the Services

## Security and compliance

AI components are subject to the same security and compliance standards as the rest of the CHILI GraFx platform. Safeguards and controls are aligned with the risk level of the specific AI-enabled capability.
