# Use of AI in CHILI GraFx

CHILI GraFx uses artificial intelligence to support creative automation workflows. AI is embedded in specific parts of the platform to reduce manual work and improve consistency. It is not a standalone product and it does not operate independently of user-defined rules, templates, or constraints.

## Where AI is used

AI is applied selectively and always in support of existing platform capabilities.

Examples of current use cases include:

- Design assistance
- Smart template creation
- Code generation for template logic
- Image annotation and detection

AI augments workflows without removing user control.

## What AI does not do

AI in CHILI GraFx has clear boundaries:

- It does not act autonomously
- It does not publish, approve, or distribute content
- It does not bypass template constraints or brand rules
- It does not make creative, legal, or business decisions

All outputs remain under user control.

## Data usage and training

- Customer data is only processed to deliver the Services provided by the platform
- Customer data is **not** used to train, enrich, or improve AI models for any other purpose
- There is no cross-customer data usage
- There is no reuse of customer data outside the scope of the Services

## Security, Compliance, and AI Governance

AI components are subject to the same security and compliance standards as the rest of the CHILI GraFx platform. All AI-powered functionality is managed within our [ISO-certified framework](/CHILI-GraFx/trust/compliance/#compliance_1), ensuring that safeguards and controls are strictly aligned with the risk level of each specific capability.

**AI Tooling and Dynamic Evaluation**

Because AI capabilities evolve rapidly, CHILI GraFx does not maintain a fixed or exhaustive list of AI tools. Instead of a static list, we apply a continuous governance model to ensure every component remains compliant:

- Integrated risk management: All AI tools undergo formal Risk Management and Tool Qualification before deployment.
- External dependency evaluation: AI components are reviewed under our standard Third-Party Dependency protocols to ensure data integrity and security.
- Purpose-driven assessment: Each capability is continuously assessed for data handling, security impact, and alignment with CHILI GraFx’s quality standards.

Only AI components that pass these internal audits and meet compliance criteria are made available within the platform.

## Ethical Engineering of Artificial Intelligence

Our organization is committed to the ethical engineering of Artificial Intelligence, ensuring that our models are developed with rigorous impartiality and integrity. By adhering to strict validation protocols, we ensure our AI solutions operate with objectivity, delivering equitable outcomes that are free from systemic discrimination or unfair bias.
