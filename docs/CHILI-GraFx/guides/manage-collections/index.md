### References vs actual templates

In the context of managing templates in a collection, it's important to understand the distinction between actual templates and the reference to that template.

When you add a template to a collection, you are simply creating a list that keeps track of the available templates in that collection. The actual template files themselves are not physically moved or altered in any way. The collection serves as a convenient catalog of templates.

Similarly, when you delete a template from a collection, it does not affect the original template. The deletion only removes the reference to that template from the collection, but the original template remains untouched.

In short: adding templates to a collection, deleting them from a collection, or removing collections altogether are administrative actions that manage the organization and accessibility of templates without making any changes to the actual template files.
