# Smart Template Editors compared

CHILI GraFx is the platform to enable multi channel creative automation.

Our vision is to provide you with 1 smart template editor for animated digital, static digital and print output.

GraFx Publisher has been around for a while and is the editor for smart templates intended for static digital and (variable-date) PDF output.

GraFx Studio is the next generation smart template editor. Our first goal is to provide you with all the tools for animated and static digital output, for the self-service use-case and for any automated workflow.
Therefore we redesigned the editor, SDK and API from scratch.

Specific features for print will be added with every future release.

If your use case is print only, then GraFx Publisher is the choice for your smart templates.

If you aim to have animated or static digital output only, then GraFx Studio is the place for you to start.

When you want to have both channels combined, please have a look at the feature comparison below. This will help you decide where to start.
