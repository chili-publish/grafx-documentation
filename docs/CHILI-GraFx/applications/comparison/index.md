# Smart Template Editors compared

**CHILI GraFx** is the platform to enable multi channel creative automation.

Our vision is to provide you with 1 smart template editor for animated digital, static digital and print output.

**GraFx Publisher** has been around for a while and is the editor for smart templates intended for static digital and (variable-data) PDF output.

**GraFx Studio** is the next generation smart template editor. Our first goal is to provide you with all the tools for animated and static digital output, for the self-service use-case and for any automated workflow.
Therefore we redesigned the editor, SDK and API from scratch.

Features for print will be added with every future release.

If your use case is **print only**, then **GraFx Publisher** is the choice for your smart templates.

If you aim to have **animated** or **static digital** output only, then **GraFx Studio** is the place for you to start.

When you want to have both channels combined, please have a look at the feature comparison below. This will help you decide where to start.
