# Smart Template Editors compared

**CHILI GraFx** is the platform to enable multichannel creative automation.

Our vision is to provide you with 1 smart template editor for animated digital, static digital and print output.

**GraFx Publisher** has been around for a while and is the editor for smart templates intended for static digital and (variable-data) PDF output.

**GraFx Studio** is the next generation smart template editor. Our goal is to provide you with all the tools for animated, static digital and print output, for the self-service use-case and for any automated workflow.

Therefore we redesigned the editor, SDK and API from scratch.

Today, the feature set for print in GraFx Publisher is still more extensive. But day by day, print-related features are added.

When you want to have both channels combined, please have a look at the feature comparison below. This will help you decide where to start.
