# CHILI GraFx Integrations


Integration is the process of connecting web applications or services with the CHILI GraFx platform, enabling them to seamlessly collaborate and exchange data or functionality.

Integrations expand the capabilities of CHILI GraFx beyond its core features by leveraging the resources and functionalities offered by other applications or services.

Conversely, applications can also enhance their capabilities by integrating with CHILI GraFx, taking advantage of its features. 

!!! Note "External Systems"
	For example, GraFx Studio can be integrated into a DAM, PIM, or DXP platform, facilitating the enrichment of static assets with smart templates. 
	
To enable external applications to connect to CHILI GraFx, an Integration must be defined within the CHILI GraFx platform, which includes a name and credentials for authentication. 

For instructions on setting up an Integration, [see our guide](/CHILI-GraFx/guides/integrations/).
