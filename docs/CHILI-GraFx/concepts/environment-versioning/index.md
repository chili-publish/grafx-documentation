# Concept of Versioning in CHILI GraFx

## Overview

Versioning in CHILI GraFx enables precise control over the SDK and engine versions deployed across different environments. This capability is crucial for maintaining consistency, compatibility, and stability in both development and production environments.

## Importance of Versioning

- **Consistency:** Ensures that all environments within a project can operate under the same software conditions, minimizing discrepancies that can lead to unexpected behaviors or bugs.
- **Compatibility:** Allows users to maintain compatibility with third-party integrations and older projects by locking in specific versions.
- **Stability:** Reduces the risk of disruptions caused by automatic updates, which may introduce breaking changes or new bugs.

## Version Control Features

- **Pin Versions:** Users can pin specific versions of the SDK and engine to any of their environments, whether production or sandbox.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Different roles such as Subscription Administrators, Environment Administrators, Template Designers, and Environment Users can manage or view version settings based on their permissions.
- **Automated Notifications:** The system notifies users when their selected version is nearing end-of-support or when a new version becomes available, ensuring that they are aware of potential updates or necessary changes.
