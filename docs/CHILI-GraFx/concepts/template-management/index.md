# CHILI GraFx Template Management

Template management involves the entire process of creating a template, making it available for users, and allowing users to customize and use the template to create different versions or variants.

## Workflow

### Templates

A GraFx Template is created by a template Designer. A template designer creates templates using [GraFx Studio](/GraFx-Studio/)

When the template is ready, it is made available by publishing it.

### Template collection

The Environment Administrator or Template Designer can now choose to gather 1 or more templates in a collection (of templates).

An example of such a collection could be:

- Event material
- POS material

### My projects

When CHILI GraFx is integrated into a custom solution, it's the custom application that will offer the templates to their end users.

When CHILI GraFx is used out-of-the-box, an end-user can login to the platform and create a project in "My Projects".

A project is a copy of the template, stored as "My project".
You start a project, by clicking a template in a collection. The template will open, and will be saved as a project in My Projects.

Projects (project files) are stored in "My projects".
