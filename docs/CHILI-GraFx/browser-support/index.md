# Browser support for CHILI GraFx

For all users: understand which web browsers are supported when using CHILI GraFx apps and services.

## Overview

CHILI GraFx is a cloud-based platform with a browser-based user interface. While rendering, data processing, and automation happen in the cloud, the user-facing apps â€” like GraFx Studio and GraFx Experience â€” run in the browser and rely on modern web technologies.

We distinguish between two levels of browser support:

- **First-party support** means we actively develop and validate the experience in this browser.
- **Best-effort support** means the browser is not part of our primary development scope. Most features will likely work, but thereâ€™s no guarantee.

Browsers outside these categories are not officially supported and may not function correctly.

## Supported browsers

### âœ… First-party support

We fully support **Chromium based browsers**

These browsers provide the most reliable experience across CHILI GraFx applications.

### ðŸ§ª Best-effort support

We aim to maintain compatibility with:

- **Apple Safari** (latest version on macOS and iOS)
- **Mozilla Firefox** (latest version)

Most functionality typically works as expected, but some behaviors may differ. We investigate reported issues on a best-effort basis but do not guarantee resolution or offer SLA coverage.

### ðŸš« Not supported

Browsers outside of the above categories are not officially supported.

This includes (but not limited to):

- Internet Explorer (any version)
- Legacy versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Non-standard or niche browsers
- Experimental or developer builds

## Recommendations

- Always use the **latest stable version** of your browser for optimal security and performance.
- Avoid browser extensions that modify default behavior (e.g., ad blockers, script injectors), as they can interfere with the CHILI GraFx interface.
