## Overview of Role Access

We're enhancing our SaaS platform's user management through a phased approach. 

Currently, Subscription Admins and Environment Admins can create templates to familiarize themselves with the system. 

However, these shouldn't be part of your main workflow, as permissions will change in upcoming phases. We're working towards an optimized platform, and we appreciate your adaptability during this transition.
