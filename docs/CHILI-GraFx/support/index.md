# CHILI GraFx support

The fastest way to contact the CHILI publish team for technical assistance is the Support Portal. You can access the [Support Portal](https://mysupport.chili-publish.com/) here. 

If your account was locked out, and you don't have access to the support portal, or you prefer to communicate by email, you can always send us an email.

In the CHILI GraFx platform, you can also access the link to support.
