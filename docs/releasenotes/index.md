### Improvements

- When applying a blend mode to a text frame you automatically go out of text edit mode (this way you can see the effect of the blend mode, because it is not applied while in text edit mode)
- You can now easily download the JSON file of the template with a "Download doc" trigger in the debug panel

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with MacBook being detected as a mobile device, causing issues with frame handles
- Fixed issue with opacity not being applied to fill and stroke for shapes
- Fixed issue when using a swatch as fill color for shapes, which caused the shape color to not change immediately on the canvas when the swatch color is changed
- Fixed issue with text not being selectable with the Text tool when a blend mode is applied to the text frame

??? note "Note for integrators"
	
	There is a minor breaking change in the Studio SDK's typings.
	It basically boils down to changing the import for the Id type, you can do it as follows:<br>
	Change `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/editor-sdk/lib/types/CommonTypes'`<br>
	To `#!typescript import { Id } from '@chili-publish/editor-sdk'`<br>
	For more information, please check out the [SDK release notes](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk/releases/tag/0.117.0){target="_blank"}.

## Mar 31, 2023 - Infrastructure update

Your [CHILI GraFx](/CHILI_GraFx/) infrastructure has been upgraded to have the latest update.

With this update, weâ€™re implementing platform infrastructure changes that greatly enhance  performance.

The update does require planned downtime, and will be transparant for you.

The update will be implemented (starting April 5) gradually on all tenants, and will happen over the following days and weeks.


## Mar 29, 2023 - GraFx Studio

Version 0.116.2, using Studio SDK [0.116.0](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk/releases){target="_blank"}

![rn_icon](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/logos/CHILI_LOGOS_OK-09.svg)

### Features

- You can now add rectangle, ellipse, and polygon shapes to your design, by using a new Shape tool in the left toolbar. In the properties panel, you can set a blend mode and change the fill and stroke color, to customize as you want. (There are still a couple of known issues, which will be addressed in the next release!)

![releasenotes](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/releasenotes/shapes.gif)

### Improvements

- You can select text on the page when the Text tool is active (previously it would create a new text frame instead)
- The layout name above the page is not scaled when zooming in or out
- Blend mode is not applied when in text edit mode (this makes editing text easier)
- Internal optimization to significantly increase the performance or rendering frames on the canvas

### Fixes

### Features

- You can now add [swatches](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/) to your Stylekit and use them in your template, e.g. to change the color of your text via a paragraph or character style (ðŸ‘‰ click the color field to open the color picker, where you can go to the swatches tab to select a swatch)
- The [color picker](/GraFx_Studio/how_to/swatches/#color-picker) now comes in two versions, one for defining a swatch (where you cannot set the opacity or select another swatch) and one for applying a color (where you can choose between a custom color or a swatch and where you can change the opacity)

### Improvements

- Renaming a font in the Stylekit is blocked (ðŸ‘‰ you cannot rename a font in the Stylekit, but this was not blocked and caused an incorrect rename state)
