# How to animate my frame

## Introduction

Be sure to first read about the [concept of Animation](/GraFx_studio/concept/animation/)

Also read about the [Animation panel](/GraFx_studio/animation/)

We will refer to terms defined in the concept page.

## Static is the default

(And we're not talking about electricity)

By default, frames are static. This means, they don't have an animation, and appear from frame 1 up to the last frame of the timeline.

Even when you "play" the animation, this frame will appear static in on stage. (on the page)

## Appearance on stage

The blue bar represents the frame. It starts from frame 1, and runs all the way to the last frame.

The frame will appear "immediately", and will stay all the way to the end.

### Move the start - or end point

Scroll all the way to the left, and select the edge (when your cursor changes into a double sided arrow), now drag the edge to the left or right. (left won't work, if it's at the beginning)

You can do the same, for the end of the bar for that frame in the timeline.

## Duration of the animation

Drag the vertical divider to the left or right.

You can always make the duration longer.

Dragging to the left will work up to the longest blue bar. I.e. if a frames shows up to 5 seconds point, you will not be able to reduce the duration below 5 seconds.
