# How to: Alternate Layouts

![Properties](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/GraFx_studio/how_to/altlayout1.png?w=850&q=80)

Alternate layouts is a concept to reduce designtime by creating several variants from the same document.

## Think different

In stead of thinking about ouput in your design, think by grouping concepts.

A leaderboard or skyscraper add are conceptually very similar. The only difference are the dimensions. Even a square add could be derived from the leaderboard design.
If the content is similar, then it's probably a good candidate for an alternate layout.

Even the animation of elements can be different. In a leaderboard your could animate an item from the far left, and in the skyscraper from the bottom. These paramaters can be set different per alternate layout.

## The basic setup

This design could be an abstract version, or a first version of the add.

The properties of the design can be found on the right, in the properties panel.

![Base Design](https://chilipublishdocs.imgix.net/GraFx_studio/how_to/altlayout2.png?w=850&q=80)

The properties of the elements on the page are shown when you select the element.

The properties of the animation of the elements show when you select the animaction icon in the properties panel.

## First alternate layout (or Sub-layout)

Click on the **plus** sign or three dots "Add sub-layout"

Rename the layout to "Skyscraper". Since your renamed, it's selected.

Select the properties panel, and change the dimentions to 160 x 600.

The new dimensions appear colored. This is because they differ from the base values.

This concept will pull through to all properties that differ from the main layout.

This concept is called **inheritance**.
