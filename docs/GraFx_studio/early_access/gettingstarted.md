# Early Access: Getting Started

GraFx Studio is the second generation of the suite of tools to automate the variants output.

Depending on your profile, we'll guide you through the documentation that is relevant to you.

The Early Access phase started in February 2022, and ends with the release of GraFx Studio Alpha.

## I want to: Integrate the editor

Targeted for: Software engineers, integrators

I am a developer, and I'm looking for the resources where to start, and how to integrate the editor.

Please check out the [SDK reference documentation](/GraFx_studio/sdk/).

To make life easy, we have created a couple of [demo integrations](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk-integration-examples){target="_blank"}, so you don't have to start from scratch.

You can use this script in your HTML to always get the latest SDK version:


``` js
<script src="https://cdnepgrafxstudioprd.azureedge.net/sdk/latest/main.js"></script>
```

Or you can use NPM to install a specific SDK version, with the following command:

``` bash
npm install @chili-publish/editor-sdk
```

The SDK is open sourced, you can find the [codebase here](https://github.com/chili-publish/editor-sdk){target="_blank"}.

## I want to: Check out the new features

Targeted for **Template designers**

I am a designer and want to check out the new user interface and create some cool animations for different layouts!

Please go to [Sandbox](https://editor2.chili-publish-sandbox.online/) and log in with your CHILI account to try it out yourself.

Take a look at this page, to get an overview of the [Template designer workspace](/GraFx_studio/workspace_elements/).
