# GraFx studio integration

GraFx studio is a client side browser application.
It contains 3 elements

- The Editor SDK
- The workspace
- Your application 

The **Editor SDK** is an open source SDK that connects the Editor Engine (also referenced as “The Canvas”) which renders your document. This engine does not have tools (aka the Editor Engine).
 
The **Workspace** is the set of panels and elements pre-built by CHILI publish to interact with your document canvas aka the **Editor SDK**.
The **workspace** will NOT be covered in this first version.

**Your application** is the custom code that will make it your application, also referenced as "the integration".
