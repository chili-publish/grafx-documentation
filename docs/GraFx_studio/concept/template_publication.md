# Template vs Publication

In the lifecycle of a document, they will all start as a template. To design / work on this template, the user will need a template designer seat.

Once a template is designed, and the designer has decided on the (possible) restrictions, the document is ready to be used.

A user (non template designer) will be able to create a publication, based on a template. That publication is defined by the restrictions set by the template designer.
