# Animation

## Static vs Animated content

### Animated by default

Any new GraFx studio, starts as an animated page.

From the birth of a document a timeline is created. To start the timeline is 5 seconds long.

### Static content

!!! Alert
	This needs to be defined, how static content will work. What frame will be used etc...

## Timeline

### 5 seconds (of fame)

To start, the length of the timeline will be 5 seconds long.

Show the timeline by enabling the "Layers / Animation" panel in the [bottom quicktools panel](/GraFx_studio/bottomquicktools/).

### Adjust the length

As soon as you adjust the length of the timeline, and add frames, they will take the new length of the timeline.

Adjusting the length of the animation can be done visually on the timeline, by moving the vertical dotted line.

You can also adjust the length of the animation in the animation panel, changing the length.

### Adding new frames to the timeline

All frames added to the page, will take the full length of the current timeline.

If you resize the timeline, newly added frames will take this new length by default.

!!! Question
	How to resize the full timeline, with all elements in there?
	
### Move the playhead

You can play the animation (in real time) by clicking the play button.

You can drag the white playhead left and right.

Each second is divided in 100 [centiseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(time)#Less_than_one_second){target="_blank"}.

!!! Alert
	The actual frames per second in the animated output, will define how many frames will be output to the rendered file.
