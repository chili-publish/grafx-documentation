# Style Kit

A Style Kit is a collection of Text Styles, Color styles, and fonts.

Elements of a "Style Kit"

	- Text: paragraph styles
	- Text: character styles
	- Swatch
	- Fonts

When you define a stylekit, you define elements that fit together in 1 group, so you can re-use the settings later in the document.

## Text: Paragraph Styles

A paragraph style is a set of attributes — like a font size and colour — that determines how the text in a paragraph looks.

!!! Tip
	A paragraph: a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering.

## Text: Character Styles

A character style is a collection of character formatting attributes that can be applied to text in a single step.

## Swatch

A swatch is a color saved inside a Stylekit.

You can define a color, give it a name and save the named color to be used later in a style.

## Fonts

"In metal typesetting, a font is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface. Each font is a matched set of type, with a piece (a "sort") for each glyph. A typeface consists of a range of such fonts that shared an overall design."
