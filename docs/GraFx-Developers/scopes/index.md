# Scopes

In the context of application integration, the concepts of permissions, privileges, and scopes are related to controlling access and defining the level of functionality that an application or user has within a system. Here's a brief summary of each concept:

## Permissions

Permissions determine what actions or operations a user or application is allowed to perform within a system. They are used to control access to specific resources, such as data, files, or functionality. Permissions can be granted or revoked based on user roles, groups, or individual settings. For example, an application may require specific permissions to read, write, or delete data from a database.

## Privileges

Privileges refer to the level of authority or access rights granted to a user or application. They define the scope of actions that can be performed, including both functional and administrative capabilities. Privileges are typically assigned based on user roles or responsibilities within an organization. For instance, an administrator may have elevated privileges to configure system settings, while a regular user may have limited privileges for basic operations.

## Scopes

Scopes define the extent of access or functionality that an application or user has within a system. They are often used in the context of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and OAuth (Open Authorization) protocols. Scopes are specified during the authorization process and determine which resources or actions an application can access on behalf of a user. For example, a social media API may define scopes for read-only access to a user's profile information, posting new content, or managing followers.

## Summary

Permissions control access to specific resources, privileges determine the level of authority or access rights, and scopes define the extent of access or functionality within a system, especially in the context of application integration. These concepts work together to ensure security, data privacy, and appropriate control over system operations.
