# Project Overview

Welcome to this project based guide which is designed to teach you how to build a Template to Project workflow in GraFx Studio with zero knowledge of the application APIs. By the end you will have a basic application that will load Templates into Projects in an end-user UI and allow you to order them for output.

What to expect of this course:

- A follow along guide broken down into sections
- Code samples for every step of the process
- Discussions on best practices

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with JavaScript, including asynchronous operations, and making HTTP requests. If you're working in a different language, the concepts should still apply. For further reading on JavaScript and HTTP, refer to Mozilla's guides on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).

## How To Use The Guide

There are two methods:

1. You could go step by step, and copy the guide to the letter.
2. You can use each section as reference while building your own project.

Method 2 has more benefits, including the flexibility to adapt the code and concepts to fit your specific project requirements. This approach encourages a deeper understanding of the principles behind the code, which can be more beneficial for long-term skill development. It allows you to experiment with different techniques and learn from the outcomes, which is critical for becoming a proficient developer. Additionally, by not adhering strictly to the guide, you challenge yourself to solve problems independently, which is a key aspect of professional growth.

We strongly encourage you to use method 2.

## The Guide
This guide is broken up in to sections. In each section we will add some additional functioanlity to our application until we reach our final template store.
