# Workshop Overview
 The goal of this workshop is to provide all the information needed to get a custom integration of GraFx studio up and running. This course will provide both code samples you can reference for every step of the process as well as discussion in each section to provide insight on how we will build each part of our integration.

Please feel free to skip ahead to any section of this course if you are looking to reference a specific item.

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with JavaScript, including asynchronous operations, and making HTTP requests. If you're working in a different language, the concepts should still apply. For further reading on JavaScript and HTTP, refer to Mozilla's guides on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP).


## How To Use The Guide

There are two methods:

1. You could go step by step, and copy the guide to the letter.
2. You can use each section as reference while building your own project.

Method 2 has more benefits, including the flexibility to adapt the code and concepts to fit your specific project requirements. This approach encourages a deeper understanding of the principles behind the code, which can be more beneficial for long-term skill development. It allows you to experiment with different techniques and learn from the outcomes, which is critical for becoming a proficient developer. Additionally, by not adhering strictly to the guide, you challenge yourself to solve problems independently, which is a key aspect of professional growth.

We strongly encourage you to use method 2.

## The Guide

This course is broken up in to sections. In each section we will add some additional functionality to our integration until we have a custom UI. Each section is represented in this repository as a folder. You can also use the table of contents below to navigate to the various sections.
