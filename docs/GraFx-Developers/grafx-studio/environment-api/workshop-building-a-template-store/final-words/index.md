# Final Words

At this point you should have an integration that heavily relies on your application database to manage workflow while using GraFx as only storage. You also have a safe implementation where you load the Studio engine with a read-only token.

## Follow-up

While this project is done, feel free to implement some other functionality such as:

- The "Remove" button, to remove Templates from our database
- A "Delete" button on Projects, to remove Projects from the database and GraFx Studio
- A orders page where you can see orders made and download the files stored on the server
