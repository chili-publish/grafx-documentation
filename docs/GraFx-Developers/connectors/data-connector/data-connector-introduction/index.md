# Data Connector Introduction

GraFx Studio provides Data Connectors as a powerful way to integrate external data sources into your templates. Data Connectors enable you to dynamically populate your templates with data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or other data services.

Data Connectors are particularly valuable for creating dynamic templates that can be populated with real-time or frequently updated data. This integration allows for the creation of personalized and data-driven documents while maintaining a consistent design.

## Examples of Data Connectors

CHILI publish and our community have developed several Data Connectors to enhance the functionality of GraFx Studio. Some common use cases include:

- [Google Sheets Connector](/GraFx-Studio/connectors/connector-google-sheets-data/): Import data from spreadsheet files
