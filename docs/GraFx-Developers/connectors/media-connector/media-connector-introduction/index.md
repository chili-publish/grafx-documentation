# Media Connector Introduction

GraFx Studio, by default, utilizes [GraFx Media](/GraFx-Media/) to provide access to image assets. Media Connectors are a specialized type of Connector that enable GraFx Studio to access and utilize assets from external, non-GraFx sources.

Media Connectors are particularly valuable for integrating with Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems, allowing users to seamlessly access their photos within GraFx Studio. This integration streamlines workflow and enhances productivity by providing a unified interface for asset management and design creation.

## Examples of Media Connectors

CHILI publish and our community have developed several Media Connectors to enhance the functionality of GraFx Studio. Some notable examples include:

- [Acquia Connector](/GraFx-Studio/connectors/connector-acquia-dam/): Enables connection to your Acquia DAM instance, providing access to your organization's digital assets.
