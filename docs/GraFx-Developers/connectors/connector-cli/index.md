# Connector CLI

The CLI (Command Line Interface) is part of the tooling we offer to get you up and running.

This will help you to instantiate, build, test and deploy your custom connector.

## Installation

The "-g" option will make sure the command line tool is available on a "global" level, meaning also outside of your directory. In case you want to work on several connectors, you can call the tool from any directory.

```bash
npm install -g @chili-publish/connector-cli
```

You can now execute the command (in the terminal, in any directory)

To understand what the CLI can do, you can now execute

```bash
connector-cli -h
```

This will give you an overview of the available commands
