# Introduction to GraFx Experience

![applogo](/assets/Logo_GraFx_Experience.svg)

GraFx Experience is the brand execution portal of CHILI GraFx.

It gives users an easy interface to find on-brand resources from [Design Systems](/GraFx-Experience/reference/glossary/design-system/), personalize them safely, and export finished assets ready for use.

GraFx Experience lets non-design users produce on-brand content without specialized tools. It reduces bottlenecks between central design teams and local execution.

## Brand execution examples

- **Retail field marketing:** Field marketers generate on-brand ads, point-of-sale signage, and promotional materials tailored to their store’s needs.

- **Shopper marketing at scale:** Local teams produce shopper-specific materials for entrance displays, aisle signage, and checkout offers while staying brand compliant.

- **Territory sales collateral:** Regional sales teams create brochures, price lists, and contact-specific offers that reflect local context but retain brand integrity.  

- **Franchise campaigns:** Franchise owners adapt national campaigns with local messaging, promotions, and store details under brand rules.  

- **Hyper-localized output:** Generate customer or store-specific catalogs, flyers, price labels, and digital assets from one Design System with minimal manual work.
