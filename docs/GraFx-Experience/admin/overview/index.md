# Admin overview

Admins control the setup and governance of **GraFx Experience**.  
You define access, structure content, and shape what end users see and do.

## Users & groups

Users are organized into **groups**. Groups determine what users can see and do in Experience.

- Invite users and assign global roles (User, Admin, Account Owner).  
- Add users to groups that grant specific access.  
- Edit or remove users, roles, and group memberships.  
- Suspend or re-enable users.

Group configuration is the primary mechanism for managing access.

## Permissions control

Permissions are always set at the group level.  
Permissions determine:

- Which pages and spaces a group can access
- Which Design Systems are available
- What actions (view, create, export) are allowed

Users only see and do what they are permitted through their group memberships.

## Pages & navigation

Admins build the front-end structure for users:

- Create and edit pages
- Arrange pages in navigation
- Set page access by group
- Rename and reorder pages
- Enable or disable pages

Pages form the navigable portal; disabled pages are hidden even if linked.

## Spaces & environments

Spaces let you segment content for different audiences or scenarios:

- Create specific spaces (e.g., by team, region, brand)
- Configure navigation and pages per space
- Assign group access per space
- Use launch behaviors to direct users into a space

Spaces help map organizational structure into the portal.

## Design Systems integration

Design Systems built in **GraFx Studio** power end-user execution. Admin tasks include:

- Register Design Systems for Experience
- Map which variables appear in the UI
- Control how inputs are exposed to users

This determines how users personalize content in a governed way.

## Extensions

Extensions add functionality to your portal:

- Activate the **GraFx Experience layer** extension
- Enable other extensions (media, translations, layouts)
- Configure how extensions are presented

Extensions extend the portal’s capabilities beyond the core.

## Branding & login

Admins control the portal’s look and first impression:

- Customize the login page for your organization
- Apply brand identity (logos, colors, visuals)
- Configure post-login behavior and redirect pages

Branding and login setup reinforce your corporate presence.

Admin configuration determines the look and behavior of the Experience portal — there is no fixed UI, only what you build.
