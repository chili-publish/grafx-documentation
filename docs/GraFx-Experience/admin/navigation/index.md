# Navigation structure

Navigation in GraFx Experience is defined by the pages and folders you create and the order in which you place them. As an admin, you control the **hierarchy, grouping, labels, and visibility** of navigation items to match your audience and use cases.

## Main navigation

The **main navigation** is the primary horizontal menu users see at the top of the portal on desktop or equivalent primary navigation on mobile.

As an admin you decide:

- Which top-level pages appear here
- The order of navigation items
- Labels that are shown to users
- Whether certain pages are omitted from the navigation

Keep the main navigation focused — too many items make it harder for users to find what they need.

## Sub-menu navigation

Sub-menus are created by placing pages inside **folders** in the page tree.

- Folders group related pages and create a second (or deeper) level of navigation
- Pages inside a folder appear in a dropdown or sub-menu under the folder’s label
- You can nest folders up to configured levels to create up to three navigation tiers

Navigation depth and labels should reflect logical groupings so users navigate intuitively.

## Page vs navigation name

Each page has:

- A **Title** — internal admin label shown in the page tree
- A **Navigation name** — label shown in menus

Navigation names can differ from titles. Use clear, short navigation names to improve usability when screens have limited space.

## Visibility control

Admins can control visibility by page or folder:

- **Enabled / Disabled** — A disabled item does not appear in navigation or in direct links
- **Hide from navigation** — Page exists and is accessible by link but does not show in menus

Use visibility settings to control access paths and reduce clutter.

## Space-specific navigation

If you use multiple **spaces** or environments:

- Each space has its own navigation structure
- Pages and menus can differ per space
- Similar pages can have different navigation names in different spaces

Spaces let you tailor navigation to teams, regions, or business units.

## Best practices

- Limit top-level items to essential categories
- Use folders to group related pages logically
- Use clear, short navigation names that match user expectations
- Control visibility to simplify menus for each user group
- Review navigation with actual end users for clarity

Navigation is not fixed by the system — it is created by you through page order, folders, labels, and visibility settings. Done deliberately, it guides users to the right content quickly and consistently.
