# Pages

Admins create and manage the pages that make up a **GraFx Experience** portal. Pages determine what users see and how they navigate the portal.

## Page editor

To edit a page:

- While logged in as an admin, open the page.
- Click the **edit (pencil) icon** in the lower right.
- The page opens in the editor.
- Save your changes or publish them for all users.

The editor shows:
- Controls for adding or modifying content
- Options for saving drafts or publishing
- Tools for arranging and managing pages

## Adding and editing pages

To add a new page:

1. Open the **page tree** panel.
2. Click **Add page**.
3. Choose the page type you want.
4. Enter a page title and initial settings.
5. Place the page where it should appear in the tree.

To edit an existing page:

- Select it in the page tree.
- Modify content directly in the editor.
- Save or publish when done.

## Page types

Choose a page type when creating:

- **Blank page** – start with an empty canvas and add elements.
- **Assets page** – configured to display media content.
- **Layouts page** – includes layout or smart content widgets.
- **GraFx Studio page** – includes embedded Experience interaction.

Different page types provide different built-in widgets and behaviors.

## Page tree management

In the page tree you can:

- Reorder pages and folders by drag & drop.
- Rename pages.
- Duplicate existing pages.
- Delete pages you no longer need.
- Disable pages so they don’t show up in navigation.

Disabled pages are not accessible even by direct link.

## Page settings

Each page offers configuration in these areas:

### General

- **Title:** Name shown in the page tree.
- **Navigation name:** Label used in menus and navigation.

Navigation name can differ from the title for clarity.

### Access

Control who can see the page:

- Inherit permissions from the parent folder or space.
- Or assign specific groups that can view the page.

Users will only be able to access the page if they are in a permitted group.

### Visibility

- **Enabled:** When unchecked, the page is hidden from users.
- **Hidden from navigation:** The page still exists and can be accessed by link but won’t appear in menus.

## Summary

Admins use the page editor and page tree to build a navigable portal:

- Create structured navigation with folders and pages
- Choose page types that fit your content and widgets
- Set access permissions based on groups
- Control visibility to tailor the user experience

Pages define how users discover and interact with Experience content. Building them clearly and consistently improves the experience for everyone.
