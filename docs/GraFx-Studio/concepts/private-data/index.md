# Private Data (in Variables)

## Overview

In GraFx Studio, variables control user input and interactions. These variables are visible in the **Studio UI** and can be toggled to be visible or required in the **Studio Workspace**.

For advanced use cases, **Private Data** allows extra information to be passed to custom integrations without affecting the Studio or End-user UI. It’s designed for scenarios where additional data is needed for specific integrations.

## What is Private Data?

**Private Data** is information attached to a variable that is not visible in GraFx Studio or to the end user but is accessible through custom integrations.

## Key Features of Private Data

- **Non-disruptive:** It does not alter the variable's behavior in GraFx Studio or the End User Interface.
- **Integration-specific:** Used by integrations to provide extra private data.
- **Customizable:** Tailored to your integration’s requirements.
