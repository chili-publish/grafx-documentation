# Stylekit

A stylekit is a collection of text styles, color styles, and fonts.

Elements of a "stylekit":

	- Text: paragraph styles
	- Text: character styles
	- Swatch
	- Fonts

When you define a stylekit, you define elements that fit together in one group, so you can reuse the settings later in the document.

## Text: Paragraph Styles

A paragraph style is a set of attributes, such as font size and color, that determines how the text in a paragraph looks.

## Text: Character Styles

A character style is a collection of character formatting attributes that can be applied to text in a single step.

## Swatch

A swatch is a color saved inside a Stylekit.

A [swatch](/GraFx-Studio/guides/swatches/) is a color saved inside a Stylekit. You can define a color, give it a name, and save the named color to be used later in a style.

## Fonts

In metal typesetting, a font is a particular size, weight, and style of a typeface. Each font is a matched set of type, with a piece (a "sort") for each glyph. A typeface consists of a range of such fonts that share an overall design.

You can add fonts through the backoffice in GraFx Publisher. They will then be visible in your.
