# Crop Marks

To print an image without a blank area around the image, the non-printing areas must be trimmed after printing. Crop marks can be used to show the printer where the printing area ends, and the non-printing area begins. The part which is trimmed off is called [bleed](../../../GraFx-Studio/concepts/bleed/).

Crop marks will get a white offset, to see them better on dark(er) backgrounds.

The crop marks have a fixed length of 6 mm (recommended by the [Ghent Workgroup](https://gwg.org/))

!!! info "Registration color"
    Crop marks are always in **Registration color** to ensure they are visible on all color plates.  
    Registration color means 100% of all process and spot colors, regardless of the colors that are used in the document.
