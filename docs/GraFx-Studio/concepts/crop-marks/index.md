# Crop Marks

To print an image without a blank area around the image, the non-printing areas must be trimmed after printing. Crop marks can be used to show the printer where the printing area ends, and the non-printing area begins. The part which is trimmed off is called [bleed](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/bleed/).

Crop marks will get a white offsite, to see them better on dark(er) backgrounds.
