## Constraints

In CHILI GraFx, **constraints** are designer-defined boundaries that control how template elements behave. They aren’t arbitrary limits — they encode design intent and protect layout and brand standards while allowing controlled user interaction.

## Why Constraints Matter

A design system sets visual and structural rules. Without constraints, templates are freeform and inconsistent. Constraints turn a design system into a governed editing space: they specify *what can change*, *how*, and *how much* — ensuring consistency at scale while giving users useful freedom.

## What Constraints Do

Constraints govern key interactions, for example:
- Whether an object can be moved or resized.
- How content expands or contracts.
- If rotation is allowed and to what degree.

This ensures edits stay within safe, predictable bounds and that outputs remain structurally sound.

## Constraints and Design Systems

A design system defines *standards.* Constraints embed those standards into the template’s interactive behavior. The template designer sets rules such as:
- An image can move within a box but not resize beyond it.
- Text can grow up to a limit, never overflow.
- Rotation is restricted or disabled.

By enforcing these rules at the template level, end users can work efficiently without breaking the design.
