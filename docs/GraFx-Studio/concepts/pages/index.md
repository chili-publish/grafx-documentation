# Multi-Page Support in GraFx Studio

**GraFx Studio** supports multi-page documents[^1].

This is primarily relevant in a **print environment**. Understanding when and why to use multiple pages depends on the **intent** of your design project.

[^1]: As of writing, a maximum of 50 pages is supported.

## When to Use Multi-Page Documents

GraFx Studio offers three [layout **intents**](../../../GraFx-Studio/concepts/layout-intent/).

## Why Multi-Page Only Makes Sense for Print

In print workflows, multi-page documents are common and essential for:

- **Brochures**: Combining several pages to convey detailed information.
- **Flyers, leaflets**: Presenting extensive content across multiple pages.
- **Business cards**: Typically front- and backside
- **Reports and Booklets**: Structuring content into chapters or sections.

In **digital static** and **digital animated** designs, the concept of multiple pages doesnâ€™t apply. These projects typically involve single-page outputs designed for screens, where navigation is handled differently (e.g., scrolling, slideshows, or animations).

## How To
