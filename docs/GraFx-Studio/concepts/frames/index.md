The width and height defines the size of the frame.

## Frame types

Depending on the type of content, you'll need a different type of frame.

### Text Frame

A text frame is made to hold text.

A text frame looks like a rectangular box when selected.

### Image Frame

An image frame is made to hold static images.

An image frame looks like a rectangular box when selected, and has a cross, when no media is available for the frame.

When media is selected / active for the frame, it will show the media.

!!! Alert
	There is no actual height difference, but Z-axis is used to refer to the relative position to the other frames.

In GraFx Studio z-index is in line with desktop editing tools. Each frame has a z-depth.
