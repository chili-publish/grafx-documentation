# Snapping

## Concept

When dragging frames around, you'll see bright lines appear.

These lines are alignment guides that align with other objects and reference points on the canvas.

## Snap points

The object you drag has several references to align to

- Frame borders
- Frame center

Guides appear when alignment to these references is close to

- Layout borders (top, bottom, left, right)
- Other frame references (top, bottom, left, right, center)

## Easter Egg
