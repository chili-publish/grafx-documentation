# Bleed (in context of printing)

In printing, bleed is printing that goes beyond the edge of where the sheet will be trimmed.[^1]

This is done to allow some tolerance when trimming (cutting) the printed material.

A 3mm bleed is considered good practice.

The bleed box is the rectangle surrounding the area defined by the paper (document) added with the bleed sizes on each side.[^2]

## Set the bleed

In the Layout properties (Print Intent only) you can set the 4 bleed dimensions.

By default, all 4 dimensions will be linked. You can set them individually by unchecking the "Same for each side" checkbox.

## Preview mode

To view the bleed, toggle the preview mode off.

You can use the shortcut "W", or deselect "Preview mode" under the hamburger menu > view.

In this example, the "Eye" of the Owl will be cut off when trimming after being printed.
