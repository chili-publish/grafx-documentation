# Barcodes

Barcodes, including QR codes, are a crucial part of modern identification and data management. They represent data visually using patterns of lines, squares, or other shapes. 

Traditional barcodes consist of parallel lines, which encode data that scanners can read.

QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional and offer greater storage capacity, allowing for encoding of URLs, text, and more.

In GraFx Studio, barcodes empower smart templates by seamlessly integrating identification and information-sharing capabilities into designs. Template designers can include barcodes to automate processes, ensure product traceability, and enhance end-user experiences.

Barcodes can hold static values and have variables linked to them.

## Configuration

Barcodes are created and configured in GraFx Studio (different than in GraFx Publisher).

## Barcode-specific settings

Depending on the type, different settings are enabled or disabled. 

The definition of the barcode defines what settings are enabled.
