# GraFx Studio Exporter for Adobe® InDesign®

## Introduction

The InDesign Conversion Plugin allows you to export documents from Adobe® InDesign® and import them into **GraFx Studio**  
This process lets you automate the creation of design variants by leveraging GraFx Studio’s powerful smart template features  
While InDesign® remains a great starting point for creative design, GraFx Studio excels at automation and multi-channel output

## Elements of the conversion

- GraFx Studio Exporter (Adobe® InDesign® plugin)  
- Importer in GraFx Studio

## How to install the plugin

### Download the plugin

Get the latest plugin from the [GraFx Studio plugin downloads](/GraFx-Studio/convert/downloads/) page.

### Install the plugin

   - Locate the `GraFxStudioExporter_InDesign_x.y.z.ccx` file (x.y.z being the version)  
   - Double-click the CCX file  
   - Follow the steps to install the plugin in Adobe® InDesign®

## How to convert a document

### Prepare your InDesign® document

   - Open the Adobe® InDesign® document you want to export  
   - Make sure the pdf settings last used do not have crop marks, bleed etc.  

The plugin uses these settings when it converts images on conversion. The [High Quality Print] is used by default.

If bleed (and other) marks are applied to these settings.

![Export Adobe PDF dialog showing Marks and Bleeds tab with all marks unchecked and bleed set to 0mm](convert23.png){.screenshot}

The images in the conversion will have the marks on them which more than likely would not be desirable.

   - Ensure all assets are properly linked  

Example: `Blue.png` is missing

### Export to GraFx Studio

   - Go to **Plugins > CHILI GraFx plugins > GraFx Studio Exporter**  
   ![Adobe InDesign Plug-Ins menu showing the CHILI GraFx plugins submenu with the GraFx Studio Exporter option highlighted](convert01.png){.screenshot}

   - Run preflight to avoid conversion issues

   - Choose a destination folder and click **Export**  
     Required only once, can be changed at any moment  
   - Choose the page to be exported  
   - Choose **All pages** to export all the pages

!!! note "Limitations"
    Exported pages must have the same size
    
    Users can skip differently sized pages or convert them to match the first page
    
    A maximum of 50 pages can be exported, with any additional pages excluded

   - Choose your layout <a id="alt-layouts"></a>  

Adobe® InDesign® supports alternate layouts (per page)  
The GraFx Studio exporter allows you to choose which page and alternate layout to export  

Choose your alternate layout, and this layout will be in the exporter file

![GraFx Studio Exporter page-selection dropdown open, listing All pages and individual pages grouped under each alternate layout (A4 V and A4 H)](alt1.png){.screenshot}

   - The plugin creates a `.zip` file containing the document and all necessary assets

    ![Contents of the exported zip: an assets folder with PDF fallbacks, a document.json file, a GraFx_Studio_Exporter.log file, and the inner 1_CHILLtronicsAd.zip](convert21.png){.screenshot}  
    - A log file with info about the plugin version, the Adobe app version, current date, and plugin warnings or errors caught during the document preflight or export  
    - The log file is named `GraFx_Studio_Exporter.log`  
    - The zip file name format: `<selected_page>_<document_name>(<optional_duplicate_copy_version>).zip`

### Import into GraFx Studio

   - Open **[GraFx Studio](https://chiligrafx.com/)**  
   - Go to **Templates > Import .ZIP** and select the exported `.zip` file  
   ![GraFx Studio Templates page with Import .ZIP and Create template buttons in the top right](convert06.png){.screenshot-full}

## Preflight

**Preflight** is the essential first step in the conversion process  
During preflight, the engine checks your document for compatibility with GraFx Studio  
This ensures that the content you are converting can be adapted efficiently for automation and variations

### How preflight works

When you initiate a conversion, the preflight engine scans the document for features that may not be fully compatible with GraFx Studio  
If any incompatible elements are found, preflight offers three options:

1. **Save as PDF asset** – The element can be saved as a PDF asset and placed into the converted document, preserving its visual integrity  
2. **Ignore** – The preflight engine changes the missing feature to a supported version (e.g., stroke type in the example)  
3. **Fix the issue** – You can adjust the feature in Adobe® InDesign® and re-run the preflight

!!! info "Placed assets: pros and cons"

    **Benefits**  
    - **Preserves quality** – Original appearance is retained  
    - **Simplifies conversion** – Avoids the need for manual adjustments for complex elements  
    
    **Limitations**  
    - **Not editable** – Static elements cannot be edited within GraFx Studio  
      For example, if text is saved as a PDF asset, you cannot create a text variable to dynamically alter the text content

## Drop Shadow support

Drop shadows applied at the **object level** in Adobe® InDesign® are supported and converted into GraFx Studio with defined constraints.

### Supported objects

- Shapes
- Image frames
- Text frames

### Supported parameters

- Opacity
- Distance
- Angle
- Size (mapped to **Blur** in GraFx Studio)
- Global Light
- X / Y offset

### Not supported

- Spread
- Blend mode
- Noise
- Shadows applied to Stroke, Fill, Text, or Graphic separately

### Preflight behavior

- A **warning is always shown** when a drop shadow is detected
- Unsupported parameters are ignored
- Visual appearance is preserved where possible

## Clipping mask support

A clipping mask is a shape that crops an image frame so only the part inside the shape shows through. The exporter translates InDesign® clipping setups into Studio-native clipping masks on image frames:

![Image with clipping mask and rounded corners](clip01.png){.screenshot-full}

!!! info "How the exporter detects a clipping mask"
    Clipping mask handling kicks in when a shape **contains an image**. Shapes without an image inside are exported to Studio as standalone shape assets — they keep their geometry, fill, and stroke, but don't act as a clipping mask. Place an image inside the shape in InDesign® if you want it converted to a clipping mask.

- **Built-in shapes** as clipping mask — rectangle, ellipse — with stroke and corner-radius properties preserved
- **Custom paths** as clipping mask — converted to a path-based clipping mask in Studio, with the path's stroke preserved
- **Nested shapes containing images** — when an image frame is pasted inside a shape, the **immediate parent shape** is exported as the clipping path, and the image's own clipping is applied on top. If that parent shape is itself nested inside further shapes, those additional parent frames are **ignored** and not exported.

Unsupported clipping setups are flagged by preflight before export.

## Compatibility

The plugin has been tested and is compatible with Adobe InDesign 2025, 2026.

## Supported features

The table below describes how Adobe® InDesign® features are converted, including where preflight intervention or fallback rendering is applied.

## Tips for successful conversion

### Simplify your design

Ensure your design uses basic text, shapes, and images for best results

### Check for unsupported features

Use the **Preflight** option in InDesign® to identify unsupported features before exporting

### Use linked assets

Make sure all images are properly linked and included in the export

### Have fonts installed in your environment

Font files are not included in the `.zip` and are not exported  
You should have all fonts installed in the platform  
Fonts will be applied to the template upon importing, and the match will be made by the font name  
Otherwise, the default font is used  

When you install the fonts after the import, GraFx Studio will try to apply them when you re-open the template

### Plan for automation

After importing to GraFx Studio, leverage smart template features to add business logic and automate variant creation

## Things to consider

- Colors not in RGB or CMYK color space (like HSB, LAB) are converted to CMYK or black  
- Adobe® Variables (like `<document_name>` `<current_date>`) are removed from text  
- Any item frame in Adobe® InDesign® (text/image) might have properties (background color, stroke, opacity)  
  Frame options are not detected by preflight and will be missed after export  
- Line shapes are always exported as `.pdf` without a preflight warning
