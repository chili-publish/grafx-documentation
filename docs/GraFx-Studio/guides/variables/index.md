## Insert variable in a text frame

Two ways of doing this

### Insert

Choose "Insert" from the variable "..." menu to insert it into a text frame

### Dropdown select

in edit mode in a text frame you can insert a variable by selecting the variable from a dropdown menu in the variables panel.

This will insert the variable at the position of the caret and the caret will be placed after the variable object, so you can continue typing. The menu shows the variables that can be inserted in a text frame (text, number, date, …). The menu shows [None] when no variable is selected.

### Double (forward) slash

When in edit mode in a text frame you can insert a variable by typing `//` (the '/' character twice). This will open a list of all variables that can be inserted in a text frame (text, number, date, …). You can select the variable from the list or start typing to use auto-complete.

## Insert variables in an image frame

To assign a variable to an image frame, select the frame and select the variable that should be assigned to it from a dropdown menu in the variables panel.

The menu shows the variables that can be assigned to an image frame (only image variables).

The menu also shows [None] as an item to remove the variable again from the frame.
