The description (2) will be shown as a second line in the export.

### Output format

The output format (3) is the chosen file type. You can still change it in the settings detail.

### Watermark

When checked, your output will have a visual watermark, and the output will not count as a render.

Add a word that will be used as the visual watermark. The word cannot be empty.

### Bar width reduction

Bar Width Reduction (BWR) is used in barcode printing to compensate for ink spread or "dot gain". It involves reducing the barcode bars' thickness so that they remain scannable after printing and ink spreading. The actual adjustment amount depends on various factors like ink, paper, and printer conditions. To get the right value, print a sample, measure the bar width, and compare it to the original file. The difference helps adjust the bar width to compensate for the printing process.

Positive values make the bars smaller, negative values make the bars wider.

### Scaling

Can be used to scale the output if your target channel requires a bigger or smaller image size.
Higher-resolution images will be used (if available in your media) to produce higher-resolution output.

### Quality

Can be used to set the quality of the output. 100% will produce the highest quality but also the largest file size. 1% will produce the lowest quality but smallest file size.
