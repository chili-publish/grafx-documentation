# Create Output Settings

[What are output settings?](/GraFx-Studio/concepts/output-settings/)

## Create output settings

In GraFx Studio, go to **Manage > Output settings** to view and configure output settings.

By default, each output format has one preconfigured setting.

To add a new setting, click the **+ Create** button.  
Give your setting a relevant name and choose an output file format.

To delete a setting, use the **...** menu at the right end of the row.

If all settings are deleted, a placeholder will indicate no output settings exist.

## PDF Output Settings

See [Generic Settings](#generic-settings-all-formats)

### Bar Width Reduction

Compensates for ink spread during printing (dot gain).  
Use positive values to make bars thinner, negative to make them wider.

### Outline Text

Outputs text as vector shapes instead of embedding fonts.  
This removes font dependencies in the resulting PDF.

Higher values mean larger file size but better image fidelity.
