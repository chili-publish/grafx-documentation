# Cropping an image

## Placing an image

When creating an image frame, and assigning an asset to the frame, a default "Fill" will be selected.

This will ensure the image is placed in the frame, and fills the image frame.

When the current layout is a "Sub-layout", resetting the crop will fall back to the Master layout settings.
