# Cropping an image

## Placing an image

When creating an image frame, and assigning an asset to the frame, a default "Fill" will be selected.

This will ensure the image is placed in the frame, and fills the image frame.

Entering crop mode, shows the actual borders of the placed image.

## Reset crop

After applying an image crop, the fit remains present but “(cropped)” is added.

The “Crop” button is still present to trigger image crop mode again. 

You can reset the crop to again apply the selected fit mode.
