- You can switch between single-line and multi-line text variable types at any time.
- When switching types, the value of the variable will be cleared.
- Prefix and suffix settings are also available for multi-line text variables.
- "Prevent line break" will prevent text wrap in the text frame.  
This means an overflow warning will show.
