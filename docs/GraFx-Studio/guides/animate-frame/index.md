## Before you animate

**Show the timeline**

Click on the Layers icon in the [bottom quick tools panel](/GraFx-Studio/overview/bottom-quicktools/).

Select the frame in the page, or in the list of layers.

If the frame is not visible on the canvas, make sure to click the **eye** symbol

**Animation tab**

Open the animation tab, in the properties panel.

## Animate the intro

!!! Tip
	If you are distracted by other frames animating through your current frame, you can hide the other frame by clicking the **eye** next to these frames.

## Test the Animation

Click the **play** button in the timeline panel to preview the animation. Adjust if needed and repeat until happy.

## Animate the emphasis

The **emphasis** allows you to hi-light the middle section of the animation.

Expand the Emphasis section in the animation panel, and choose a type of animation.

Adjust the start- and endpoint in the timeline, and test the animation.

## Animate the Outro

Expand the Outro section in the animation panel.

Set the properties for one of the behaviours for the outro action, and test the animation untill you're happy.
